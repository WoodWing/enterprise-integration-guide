They can use Content Station, Smart Connection InDesign \/ InCopy or a web browser running a web application. But also Smart Mover and Smart Connection for InDesign Server as well as third-party systems can act as a client when talking to the *application server*. All of these clients can request the *application server* through HTTP to run any of its Web Services. Enterprise Server is the *application server* and has all business logic to determine which actions are allowed, which triggers other actions, etc. The server connects through a database- independent module to the underlying SQL *database* and possibly file server to store the binary files. ## Application server layers Zooming into the *application server* reveals the following layers: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image2.png %}) An incoming Web Service request fired from a client arrives at the *interface layer*. This layer interprets the incoming structure and transforms it into a PHP object structure. The object structure is passed onto the *service* layer. The actual implementation is done at the *business layer*. This uses the *database layer* to transform the object structure into \u2018generic\u2019 SQL statements. The *DB driver layer* is responsible for translating the SQL statements into dedicated SQL for a specific database flavor, such as MySQL, MSSQL or Oracle. ## Client applications calling Web Services Client applications connect to one or many interfaces through which they fire Web Service requests. At the application server, a Web Service comes into action. The following overview shows how that is done. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image3.png %}) For example, an InDesign user has created a new document and is about to Check-In the layout. The Smart Connection plug-ins in *InDesign* are connected to the Enterprise Server through the *workflow interface*. On the user\u2019s Check-In command, they fire a CreateObjects request through the *workflow interface*. The server invokes the *CreateObjects* service to store the layout. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Protocols [since 8.0] sortid: 20 permalink: 1032-protocols --- Enterprise Server 7 (and earlier versions) supports the SOAP protocol. Because this protocol has some performance- and integration disadvantages, Enterprise Server 8 supports an additional protocol (JSON) that can be used instead of SOAP. > Note that the AMF protocol (introduced since Enterprise Server 8.0) is deprecated since Enterprise Server 10.6. ## SDK documentation vs WSDL files The SOAP protocol is defined in WSDL files. Even though the requests, responses and data structures sent between client and server are essentially the same as for the JSON protocol (only wrapped differently), the WSDL files are designed for SOAP and therefore they are not suitable for validation of JSON. And, when developing a new JSON client, it would be odd to use WSDL files to find out how requests and responses should look like. Therefore, Enterprise Server 8 ships documentation that is independent of the protocol and does no longer require WSDL knowledge. For each interface (workflow, planning, admin, etc) there is an HTML page available containing full definition of all services and data structures. All definitions are hyperlinked to ease lookups. The documentation entry point can be found here: *http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/sdk\/doc\/interfaces\/index.htm* ## Protocol choice Besides performance, the ease of integration can be important too. For a JavaScript module running in web browser, it is hard to deal with SOAP due to lack of decent libraries. For a web client, SOAP is possible, but JSON is much more suitable. The figure below shows a bunch of programming languages with their most obvious choice. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image4.png %}) See [Client Applications](client-applications.md) for more details about client applications integrating with Enterprise through specific protocols. ## Protocol abstraction On the server side, it is the responsibility of the interface layer to support protocols (SOAP and JSON). This is done for all interfaces (workflow, planning, admin, etc). In the figure below, you can see the concept of a client talking to the server. In the middle, the architectural layers of the server are shown. On the very top, where client requests arrive and the server responses depart, the interface layer is positioned. This layer unwraps the protocol notation of incoming requests and creates PHP request objects and data classes that are passed through the service layer underneath. On the way back, it wraps a protocol structure around the PHP response classes and data classes taken from the service layer before it gets sent out to client. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image5.png %}) On the far right of the figure, it shows that server plug-ins are called from service- and business layers. This shows that server plug-ins do not have to know about the protocols; this is taken care of by the server (at the interface layer). ## DIME and Transfer Server The SOAP protocol is specified in the WSDL files. The workflow and planning WSDL files still specify DIME for some services, such as for the CreateObjects workflow service: ```xml <operation name=\"CreateObjects\"> <soap:operation soapAction=\"urn:SmartConnection#CreateObjects\"\/> <input> <dime:message layout=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/ws\/2002\/04\/dime\/closed-layout\" wsdl:required=\"false\"\/> <soap:body use=\"literal\"\/> <\/input> <output> <soap:body use=\"literal\"\/> <\/output> <\/operation> ``` This does not imply that DIME -has- to be used. Instead, the File Transfer Server can be used, as explained in next chapter. For DIME, the Content element of the file attachment is used. To send files through the File Transfer Server, the FileUrl element is used. No matter which of the two methods is used, the server plug-ins use the FilePath attribute of the Attachment object. (Same for PHP web\/admin applications.) The WSDL files show that FilePath and FileUrl are introduced since Enterprise Server 8.0 as an alternative for Content: ```xml <complexType name=\"Attachment\"> <all> <element name=\"Rendition\" type=\"tns:RenditionType\"\/> <element name=\"Type\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Content\" type=\"tns:AttachmentContent\" ... \/> <element name=\"FilePath\" type=\"xsd:string\" ... \/> <element name=\"FileUrl\" type=\"xsd:string\" ... \/> <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` For these three elements, there is always one in use while the other two are nullified. ## Migration of Enterprise Server 7.x integrations The impact of the introduction of the new JSON protocol to your Enterprise Server 7.x integrations are discussed in this chapter. ### SOAP clients There is no real need to migrate your SOAP clients to support the JSON protocol because there are no plans to drop the SOAP protocol. However, there are some reasons why you might want to consider JSON instead of SOAP: Until today, there seems to be no mature SOAP library available for JavaScript (using Ajax). Building your integrations with Enterprise Server upon a shaky library could result into stability issues. A much better choice for this particular language is JSON. If you need to upload or download files and you choose for JSON, you implicitly choose for the Transfer Server, since DIME is supported for SOAP only. ### Server Plug-ins Note that Server Plug-ins do not have to deal with the new protocols at all. SOAP and JSON requests and responses travel through the very same service classes using the very same request-, response- and data classes. And, no matter which file transfer technique clients are using (DIME or Transfer Server) the Attachment data class will have the FilePath filled. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Transfer Server [since 8.0] sortid: 30 permalink: 1035-transfer-server --- Enterprise Server 7 (and earlier versions) supports the SOAP protocol through which files can be sent as DIME attachments. Because DIME has some performance- and integration disadvantages, Enterprise Server 8 supports a technique that can be used instead of DIME: the Transfer Server. This chapter explains how to *integrate* the Transfer Server. (How to *deploy* the Transfer Server can be found in the Help Center.) ## Why no longer DIME? Sending DIME attachments through SOAP implies that all request- and response data must be sent through one HTTP connection as one long binary stream. This has some important disadvantages: * For remote workers (longer distances), the throughput of the traffic safe HTTP protocol drops significantly due to packet loss and round trip times. * Sending file attachments along with messages, results in heavy memory consumption on both sides; client and server. A server claiming most of the memory to serve one client request could result into swapping out other server processes serving other clients. Memory swapping (to disk) leads to significant and unpredictable performance drops. * DIME is superseded by MTOM and therefore it got more or less dropped by 3rd-parties (such as .NET and Java). This makes it hard for integrators to use such 3rd-party tools to build a client talking to Enterprise Server. However, MTOM has the same disadvantages as mentioned above. And, both protocols are bound to SOAP, which claims the need to introduce an alternative file transfer technique when introducing alternative protocols. ## Introduction Enterprise Server 8 can act as the Transfer Server. (How to set up and configure this is explained in the Help Center.) The Transfer Server handles file uploads and downloads. This way, files travel through a different HTTP connection than the service requests and responses. The Transfer Server by itself is already quite a bit faster than DIME and has a much lower memory footprint, but moreover it allows the clients to implement various performance improvements that really make a difference, such as: * Upload\/download files asynchronously and\/or in parallel * Skip download of locally cached files * Report errors from the service -before- upload\/download (large) files * Use standard SOAP parsers that does not handle DIME System administrators can set up the Enterprise Server on one machine and the Transfer Server on another. And, there can be multiple Enterprise Servers and multiple Transfer Servers, all working together serving a group of client machines. This way, advanced load balancing is possible with use of HTTP server dispatchers. The Enterprise Server tells clients which Transfer Server to use by returning the feature 'FileUploadUrl' in the LogOnResponse. (The value is taken from the HTTP\\_FILE\\_TRANSFER\\_REMOTE\\_URL option in the configserver.php file.) The Transfer Server needs a folder to temporarily store files that are sent between clients and servers. This is called the Transfer Folder. Note that the Enterprise Server needs access to the temp files as well. ## File operations \/ HTTP methods The client uses HTTP requests to upload, download or delete files in the Transfer Folder. There is only one entry point http:\/\/&lt;FileUploadUrl&gt;\/transferindex.php that accepts the following HTTP request methods to upload, download or delete a file: * HTTP PUT: upload * HTTP GET: download * HTTP DELETE: delete For clients that do not support these HTTP methods, they can use POST and give an additional parameter 'httpmethod' in the URL like this: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?...&httpmethod=DELETE` Regardless of the HTTP method used, each request must have a \u2018fileguid\u2019 and a \u2018ticket\u2019 parameter: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?fileguid=<GUID>&ticket=<TICKET>` For file downloads, the \u2018fileguid\u2019 is already part of the file URL returned by the server through the GetObjectsReponse, but for file uploads clients need to create a new global unique identifier (GUID) in 8-4-4-4-12 format. For example: `690aebdf-93d1-ea99-6597-800994575d8c` The \u2018ticket\u2019 is returned by the server in the LogOnResponse, which needs to be picked up by clients. Only requests that send a valid ticket are handled by the Transfer Server. When the ticket is not valid, a HTTP 403 error is returned. Clients should check if the error message contains the \u201cSCEntError\\_InvalidTicket\u201d token. If so, the client should try to re-logon, and when successful, it should repeat the last operation with the Transfer Server (such as the file upload or download). Since Enterprise Server 10.2.0 it is also possible to send the ticket as a cookie. The \u2018ticket\u2019 parameter can then be omitted in the URL. This only works when the Transfer Server is accessible over the same URL as the Enterprise Server instance. In other words the Transfer Server can\u2019t be installed on a separate machine if you want to use this feature. More information about cookie based tickets can be found later in this document. ## Uploading files The figure below shows how file attachments travel along services when uploading files (such as the CreateObjects or SaveObjects workflow services). With 7.x compliant clients, they both travel through the same request and connection. With 8.0 compliant clients, there are two connections; one to the Enterprise Server and one to the Transfer Server. In this case, clients can choose between SOAP or JSON. The red color shows how request data travels through the system. The file attachments are shown in purple. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image6.png %}) When clients log in, they catch a new option named \u2018FileUploadUrl\u2019 from the FeatureSet element of the LogOn response. When the HTTP Transfer Server is configured, the value could look like this: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php` For each file to upload, clients create a new global unique identifier (GUID) in 8-4-4-4-12 format. For example: `690aebdf-93d1-ea99-6597-800994575d8c` Files are then uploaded through a HTTP PUT command whereby the GUID is passed like this: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?fileguid=<GUID>&ticket=<TICKET>` Uploads are done chunk-wise to reduce memory consumption. Clients need to catch unexpected errors (HTTP 4xx \/ 5xx) and need to follow redirections (HTTP 3xx). When uploaded, the used URL must be filled in at the Attachment-&gt;FileUrl element in the service request. ## Downloading files The following figure shows how files are downloaded, such as for the GetObjects workflow service. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image7.png %}) The server returns the file location through the service response in Attachment-&gt;FileUrl elements. Such URLs looks like this: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?fileguid=<GUID>&ticket=<TICKET>` When the client is using a 3rd-party widget that shows a preview directly (without saving locally), an optional parameter named \u201cinline=1\u201d can be given. (For example, this is used by the Content Station Web Edition.) Then, the Transfer Server returns through the HTTP response header the disposition attribute set to \u201cinline\u201d value. When the inline parameter is left out, the disposition is set to the \u201cattachment\u201d value, resulting in a Save-As dialog. Additionally to the URL example given above, there is another parameter, named \u201cformat\u201d. This contains the mime-type of the file to download. This parameter is required and provided by the server. It enables the Transfer Server to return the Content-Type field through the HTTP response header. The client can check its local cache if this version of the file has already been downloaded before. If not, it retrieves the file through a HTTP GET command by following the given URL. Downloads are done chunk-wise to reduce memory consumption. Clients need to catch unexpected errors (HTTP 4xx \/ 5xx) and needs to follow redirections (HTTP 3xx). Since Enterprise Server 10.0.0 \/ 9.8.2 \/ 9.4.9 there is an optional parameter named \u201cfilename\u201d to improve integrations with HTML based clients, such as Content Station HTML. When provided, the Transfer Server returns that filename in the Content-Disposition header enriched with a file extension (as resolved through the EXTENSIONMAP option in the configserver.php file). For previous versions, or when the \u201cfilename\u201d parameter is left out, the fileguid is returned instead. ## Compression for up-\/downloading files \\[since 9.5\\] In order to reduce the upload and download time of files for remote users, the File Transfer Server can compress and de-compress files by using a file compression technique. Whether or not compression is actually used is defined by the client, while the File Transfer Server informs the client which compression techniques are available. The compression techniques are returned in the LogOnResponse by a feature named \u2018AcceptsCompressions\u2019: ```xml <ServerInfo> ... <FeatureSet> <Feature> <Key>AcceptsCompressions<\/Key> <Value>deflate<\/Value> <\/Feature> <\/FeatureSet> ... ``` In the above example, the client is informed that the 'deflate' compression technique can be used. When multiple techniques are defined, these are comma-separated. These techniques are built-in and therefore the features are provided automatically and they can not be configured. Currently, \u2018deflate\u2019 compression is supported only. ## Remote workers and remote locations \\[since 9.5\\] File compression should only be used for remote workers. To differentiate such workers from local workers, the options named \u2018REMOTE\\_LOCATIONS\\_INCLUDE\u2019 and \u2018REMOTE\\_LOCATIONS\\_EXCLUDE\u2019 of the configserver.php file are used. For a full explanation on how to use these options, see the comments in the configserver.php file. In the LogOnResponse, Enterprise Server returns this as follows: ```xml <ServerInfo> ... <FeatureSet> <Feature> <Key>IsRemoteUser<\/Key> <Value>true<\/Value> <\/Feature> <\/FeatureSet> ... ``` If the Value equals \u2018true\u2019, the client IP is treated as remote (according to the configuration options), else \u2018false\u2019 is returned. When the \u2018IsRemoteUser\u2019 feature is set to \u2018true\u2019 and the \u2018AcceptsCompressions\u2019 feature lists the \u2018deflate\u2019 technology, the client could request the Transfer Server to compress a file (server side) while downloading as follows: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?\u2026&compression=deflate` In the same manner, it could request the Transfer Server to uncompress the file (server side) while accepting a file being uploaded. Regardless of the features returned in the LogOnResponse, it is up to the client to decide whether or not (and when) to apply compression. Please use compression with care. For example: it does not make sense to compress JPEG or ZIP because these files are already compressed. It would lead to taking up CPU processing without an actual reduction in file transfer time. Content Station 9.5 uses Deflate compression when remote users are saving (uploading) or opening (downloading) WCML articles. This feature becomes affective when in the LogOnResponse the \u2018IsRemoteUser\u2019 feature is set to \u2018true' and the \u2018AcceptsCompressions\u2019 feature lists the \u2018deflate\u2019 technology. ## Signed Transfer Server URLs \\[since 10.7\\] Since Enterprise Server version 10.7.0 it is possible to request signed download links from the server. The signed URL allows clients to download files from the Transfer Server without knowing the ticket and fileguid. The signed url can only be generated with a client that has a valid session ticket and the token is only valid for a specific period of time for only the file it was generated for. This feature is useful when you want to get a download link and pass it to a different application (for example for downloading). To request a signed URL from the server you can add the following parameters to the web service entry point. An example URL would be: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/index.php?protocol=JSON&transfer=HTTP&signedUrls=true&autoCleanUrls=true` The possible options are: * compressionEnabledUrls * When compressionEnabledUrls is true the compression parameter will be added to the url or added to the token when signedUrls is true. The compression parameter is automatically set to 'deflate'. * signedUrls * When signedUrls is true a token will be generated that is valid for a number of seconds as configured with FILE_TRANSFER_SIGNED_URL_TIMEOUT in the configuration of the server. * autoCleanUrls * When autoCleanUrls is true the autoclean parameter is added to the generated url or token. This will clean the file from the Transfer Server folder after downloading. In combination with signedUrls this means that the download is valid only once. When the signedUrls option is given Transfer Server URLs are returned like: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?token=<generated_token>` Uploading files can also be executed with a signed URL. First you need to call the transfer index with the following parameter (with a valid Enterprise Server ticket): `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?uploadtokens=<number_of_upload_tokens>` Unique tokens are then generated and returned as a JSON encoded array. The token already contains a unique fileguid parameter so there is no need to generate this guid in the client. The files can then be uploaded by calling the following URL (no need for a ticket): `PUT ..\/transferindex.php?token=<token>` The same URL can then be used as FileURL when calling the Enterprise Server services. ## Deleting files The separation of messages and file transfers can have big performance gains in all kinds of situations. This heavily depends on the smartness of the client application. For example, suppose the client does a CreateObjects request. In case of DIME, one message is sent that includes the whole native file. In case the create action fails, Enterprise Server returns an error (for example \u2018Name already exists\u2019). Once the end-user has corrected the error, the client has to send the whole message again, including the native file. Instead, when the client uses the Transfer Server to upload the native file, it can decide to leave the already uploaded file on the Transfer Folder when such an error occurs. This time, it just sends the user changed metadata again (to correct the error), while it leaves the native file untouched. This saves a lot of transfer\/waiting time. After the CreateObjects service request is handled successfully, it sends a HTTP DELETE request to the Transfer Server to delete the uploaded file from the temporary Transfer Folder. Doing so, the file GUID is passed like this: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?fileguid=<GUID>&ticket=<TICKET>` It is the client application\u2019s responsibility to clean files in the Transfer Folder. When there are files left behind, it is considered to be a client bug. In very exceptional situations, such as client crashes, there could be files left behind though. For those cases an Enterprise Server Job can be used to clean up the Transfer Folder. Nevertheless, clients should not rely on this feature since the folder might then rapidly grow, especially for large systems with many users. ## Sequence diagram Clients sending requests with file uploads first do the uploads and then the request. On download, they wait for the response and then start the download. The diagram below shows the interactions between client and server. Note that at the very end, the client cleans the files on the file transfer server. The reason why the server should not do this for the uploaded files is that when the request fails due to business logics (for example no access rights), the client could leave the files as-is, and try again with different parameters (for example a user choosing another Category). And, it enables clients to build async solutions in future too. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image8.png %}) ## Connector interface classes To support the new transfer methods changes had to made to the connector interfaces. **_Preview\\_EnterpriseConnector class:_** * before 8.0: generatePreview( **\\$format, \\$buffer**, \\$max, &\\$previewFormat, &\\$meta, \\$bizMetaDataPreview ) * since 8.0: generatePreview( **Attachment \\$attachment**, \\$max, &\\$previewFormat, &\\$meta, \\$bizMetaDataPreview ) **_MetaData\\_EnterpriseConnector class:_** * before 8.0: readMetaData( **\\$format, \\$buffer**, \\$bizMetaDataPreview ) * since 8.0: readMetaData( **Attachment \\$attachment**, \\$bizMetaDataPreview ) Plugins implementing these connectors have to be changed and must respect the new function parameters. ## How to handle attachments within your server plug-ins As content is no longer directly stored within the attachment object, new functions are made available to read and write content. These functions are provided by the BizTransferServer.class.php module (located in &lt;Enterprise&gt;\/server\/bizclasses\/). To call these functions, a BizTransferServer instance must be created first. As stated before, these functions can be used regardless the file transfer method. Examples: ***read attachment:*** ```php require_once BASEDIR . '\/server\/bizclasses\/BizTransferServer.class.php' $transferServer = new BizTransferServer(); $content = $transferServer->getContent( $attachment ); ``` ***write attachment:*** ```php require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/bizclasses\/BizTransferServer.class.php'; $attachment = new Attachment(\u2018native\u2019, 'image\/jpeg'); $transferServer = new BizTransferServer(); $transferServer->writeContentToFileTransferServer( $content, $attachment ); ``` ## Handshake \u201cDo you speak English?\u201d. That question is heard at touristic places quite often. But what answer do you expect from people who do not speak English at all? Introducing JSON brings similar challenges; How can a client start talking to a server without knowing what server it is talking to and what protocols it understands? This challenge is new with Enterprise Server 8.0; Before, only SOAP and DIME were supported. But now, the listed servers (configured in WWSettings.xml or configserver.php) need to be accessed with care, before clients start talking new protocols. Clients have no idea what server version they start talking to since they can not look into the future. ### Choosing the best protocol and file transfer To find out, there is a very lightweight handshake done between client an server. The client fires an empty HTTP request to the entry point with a new handshake parameter. For example this is what a client sends to the workflow entry point: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/index.php?handshake=v1` This tells that the client understands (version 1 of) the handshake. Enterprise Server 7 does not support handshakes and returns the logon page (HTML). This is not XML, so the client can safely assume DIME over SOAP needs to be chosen. When the client does not support it, it should raise an error that it is not compatible with the selected server. Enterprise Server 8 (and later) will return a home brewed XML structure like this: ```xml <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <EnterpriseHandshake version=\"1\"> <Techniques> <Technique protocol=\"SOAP\" transfer=\"HTTP\"\/> <Technique protocol=\"JSON\" transfer=\"HTTP\"\/> <Technique protocol=\"SOAP\" transfer=\"DIME\"\/> <\/Techniques> <Interfaces minVersion=\"7\" maxVersion=\"8\"> <Interface name=\"Administration\" type=\"core\"\/> <Interface name=\"AdminDataSource\" type=\"core\"\/> <Interface name=\"DataSource\" type=\"core\"\/> <Interface name=\"Planning\" type=\"core\"\/> <Interface name=\"Publishing\" type=\"core\"\/> <Interface name=\"Workflow\" type=\"core\"\/> <\/Interfaces> <\/EnterpriseHandshake> ``` This tells the client that: * JSON can be combined with HTTP, but not with DIME * SOAP can be combined with HTTP or DIME * SOAP over HTTP is preferred above SOAP over DIME The client knows what protocols and transfers it supports (by itself) and now picks the best match that is most preferred by the server. Now it reconnects to the entry point again to let server know its choice, for example: `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/index.php?protocol=JSON&transfer=HTTP` When the client does not connect this way (leaving out the protocol and transfer parameters), the server assumes the client is 7.x (or older) and starts using DIME over SOAP for backwards compatibility reasons. For each request, the client may choose other parameters. For example, it might support JSON, but still does SOAP for some specific services that have not been ported to JSON yet. Note that the parameters can be applied to all public interfaces: workflow, planning, administration, datasource, datasource admin and publish. Internal application interfaces support SOAP only. In theory, for each interface used by clients, there should be a handshake. However, there is no reason to support other protocols (for one or the other) from a server point of view. Clients may reuse the returned handshake data assuming it is the same for all interfaces. ### Listing the configured servers First, the list of servers needs to be determined. When there are one or more &lt;SCEnt:ServerInfo&gt; elements below the &lt;SCEnt:Servers&gt; element, it means that the list of servers is configured client side (WWSettings.xml) and so they are shown at login dialog right away without server interaction. But, when there is one &lt;SCEnt:ServerInfo&gt; element -directly- below the &lt;Settings&gt; element in the WWSettings.xml file, it means that the list of servers is configured server side (configserver.php). Before talking to the server, clients do a handshake. This determines the protocol and the file transfer technique. When that is known, the client calls the server through a GetServers service to get the list of server to show in the login dialog. Now the user picks one of the listed servers and attempts to log in. Before talking to the selected server, clients do a handshake. After choosing the best protocol and file transfer, clients set the protocol and transfer parameters to the URL and fire a LogOn request. ### Sequence diagram: server-side config When servers are configured server-side, this is the sequence dialog of the handshake: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image9.png %}) Because there can be a mix of server versions, clients needs to do the second handshake too; It could be the case there is a 8.0 server listing a 7.0 server or the other way around. ### Sequence diagram: client-side config When servers are configured client-side, this is the sequence dialog of the handshake: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image10.png %}) ## Migration of Enterprise Server 7.x integrations Changes made to Enterprise Server 8 are done with care; The impact to clients and Server Plug-ins is reduced as much as possible. Nevertheless, SOAP clients are encouraged to migrate and Server Plug-ins (that are dealing with file attachments) are forced to migrate. ### SOAP clients Although DIME is still supported for backwards compatibility reasons, SOAP clients are strongly encouraged to move along with the server and start using the File Transfer Server. ### Server Plug-ins To reduce memory consumption, the way file content is passed on through your Server Plug-ins has been adapted (by Enterprise Server). You need to adjust your plug-ins only when they use the Attachment or SOAP\\_Attachment data objects. The SOAP\\_Attachment is no longer used. The Attachment has no longer the Content element set (carrying the whole file in memory). There is a new element named FilePath from where you can read. Best is to leave the file on disk. Or else, try to read chunk-wise to avoid memory consumption. Reading the whole file in memory should be avoided, especially for native file renditions. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Server Info sortid: 31 permalink: 1244-server-info --- Under the umbrella of a certain `Enterprise installation` all application servers and client applications are sharing one-and-the-same `storage location`. As a database system or database instance may contain multiple storage locations, we avoid these terms in this chapter. In short, one `Enterprise installation` is bound to one `storage location`. During the first time installation Enterprise Server generates a global unique identifier named `Enterprise System ID` and stores it in its `storage location`. Once this ID is determined, it will never change. It uniquely identifies the `Enterprise installation` world wide. ## Server identification A client application may want to cache some information that originates from a specific `Enterprise installation`. Or, it may want to call certain services that were introduced in later versions of Enterprise Server. So there is a need know to which `Enterprise installation` it connects to. The Enterprise Server URL may change over time, and an `Enterprise installation` may get upgraded while reusing the very same URL. In other words, clients should never use URL to cache information that originates from a particular `Enterprise installation` nor compare URLs to conclude whether one instance differs from another. Instead of the Enterprise Server URL, the `Enterprise System ID` should be used to uniquely identify an `Enterprise installation`. There are several ways how to retrieve this ID as described hereafter. ### GetServers service Although this service has been introduced since earlier versions of Enterprise, since Enterprise Server 10.8 the response contains the `Enterprise System ID`. This ID is only provided for the `ServerInfo` item that represents the `Enterprise installation` being requested. Note that the `GetServers` service does not require a ticket and therefore it can be called even before calling the `LogOn` service. Example request in JSON: ```json { \"method\": \"GetServers\", \"id\": \"1\", \"params\": { \"req\": { \"__classname__\": \"WflGetServersRequest\" } }, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" } ``` Example response in JSON: ```json { \"id\": \"1\", \"result\": { \"Servers\": [ { \"Name\": \"Enterprise\", \"URL\": \"http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php\", ... \"Version\": \"10.8.0 Build 123\", ... \"EnterpriseSystemId\": \"f8210fed-3e64-a351-bfa7-55e9a7bd83bf\", \"__classname__\": \"ServerInfo\" } ], \"CompanyLanguage\": \"enUS\", \"__classname__\": \"WflGetServersResponse\" }, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" } ``` ### GetServerInfo service [since 10.7] Example request in JSON: ```json { \"method\": \"GetServerInfo\", \"id\": \"1\", \"params\": { \"req\": { \"Ticket\": \"...\", \"__classname__\": \"WflGetServerInfoRequest\" } }, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" } ``` Example response in JSON: ```json { \"id\": \"1\", \"result\": { \"ServerInfo\": [ { \"Name\": \"Enterprise\", \"URL\": \"http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php\", ... \"Version\": \"10.8.0 Build 123\", ... \"EnterpriseSystemId\": \"f8210fed-3e64-a351-bfa7-55e9a7bd83bf\", \"__classname__\": \"ServerInfo\" } ], \"__classname__\": \"WflGetServerInfoResponse\" }, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" } ``` ### LogOn service Although this service has been introduced since earlier versions of Enterprise, since Enterprise Server 9.2 the response contains the `Enterprise System ID`. Example request in JSON: ```json { \"method\": \"LogOn\", \"id\": \"1\", \"params\": { \"req\": { \"User\": \"John\", \"Password\": \"***\", \"Ticket\": \"\", ... \"RequestTicket\": null, \"RequestInfo\": [ \"ServerInfo\" ], \"Params\": null, \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnRequest\" } }, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" } ``` Example response in JSON: ```json { \"id\": \"1\", \"result\": { \"Ticket\":\"...\", ... \"ServerInfo\": { \"Name\": \"Enterprise\", \"URL\": \"http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php\", ... \"Version\": \"10.8.0 Build 123\", ... \"EnterpriseSystemId\": \"f8210fed-3e64-a351-bfa7-55e9a7bd83bf\", \"__classname__\": \"ServerInfo\" } ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnResponse\" }, \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\" } ``` ### Ping service [since 10.2] The most lightweight service to resolve the `Enterprise System ID` is the following: * `http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php?test=ping` Unlike the examples provided in the chapters hereinabove, the ping service request is _not_ a JSON RPC request but a simple HTTP GET request. The service may (or may not) return a JSON body, depending on the Enterprise Server version: * 3.0 - 10.1 gives a HTTP 302 (redirect to the admin logon page) * 10.2 - 10.7 gives a HTTP 200 with an empty body * 10.8 or newer gives a HTTP 200 with a JSON body (see example below) Example response [since 10.8]: ```json { \"Name\": \"Enterprise\", \"Version\": \"10.8.0 Build 123\", \"EnterpriseSystemId\": \"f8210fed-3e64-a351-bfa7-55e9a7bd83bf\", \"ContentStationUrl\": \"http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/contentstation\/\" } ``` ## Server status service [since 10.8] For a load balancer you may want to configure a light service that periodically determines whether an `Enterprise installation` is still healthy. The following service request can be configured: * `http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php?test=status` Unlike the examples provided in the chapters hereinabove, the server status service request is _not_ a JSON RPC request but a simple HTTP GET request. The service may (or may not) return a JSON body, depending on the Enterprise Server version: * 3.0 - 10.1 gives a HTTP 302 (redirect to the admin logon page) * 10.2 - 10.7 gives a HTTP 200 with an empty body * 10.8 or newer gives a HTTP 200 with a JSON body (see example below) Example response: ```json { \"Name\": \"Enterprise\", \"Version\": \"10.8.0 Build 123\", \"EnterpriseSystemId\": \"f8210fed-3e64-a351-bfa7-55e9a7bd83bf\", \"ContentStationUrl\": \"http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/contentstation\/\", \"Status\": { \"Filestore\": \"OK\", \"Database\": \"OK\", \"FileTransferServer\": \"OK\" } } ``` If all items under the `Status` entry indicate `OK`, this service returns a `HTTP 200 OK`. If any of the items indicate `ERROR` the service returns a `HTTP 500 Internal Server Error`. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Elvis Proxy Server [since 10.5] sortid: 32 permalink: 1061-elvis-proxy-server --- A proxy server is added to the Elvis plug-in for Enterprise Server to expose the Elvis Preview API to Enterprise client applications. This is called the Elvis proxy server. The client may request for an Elvis image preview, which then will be proxied to the Elvis Server Preview API. The client may also let the user create a crop of an image, which can be requested through the API as well. > **Note** - At the time writing this chapter, there are no client applications using the proxy server yet. Compared with the Transfer Server, using the proxy has the following advantages: * Faster download because the proxy provides a download stream (while the Transfer Server saves the file in the Transfer Folder). * The client application can define preview dimensions\/resolution that suits the best in its UI. * Provides 'stable' URLs <sup>1)<\/sup>, which have the following advantages: * The client application can share the download URL with other clients or users. * The preview URLs can be embedded in a text document. * Enables usage of the web browser cache to avoid downloading the same preview over and over again. * The same API can be used to make image crops. * Support for the `ETag` HTTP header to avoid preview download when client application has latest version already. (In this header the client can provide the current version number and the server will return HTTP 304 without file when it is the latest version, or HTTP 200 with file if there is a newer version.) Web browsers also support this protocol, so web applications automatically gain from this optimization. > 1\\) **'Stable' URLs** contain the whole preview\/crop download definition, so they never have to be adjusted e.g. to be used in another context. Authorization is done through HTTP headers, to exclude access tokens or tickets from the URL, which may vary per user session or client application. The responsibilities of the proxy server are: * Check the Enterprise ticket and authorize the Enterprise user. * Validate file access to the image in Enterprise, with access rules defined in Enterprise. * Setup a trust connection with Elvis and authorize the Elvis user. * Provide 'stable' URLs to support web browser cache. * Expose the Elvis API to the client, but hide the Elvis location (base URL). * Resolve the Elvis asset id from an Enterprise object id. * Stream the image preview (or crop) back to the waiting client application. The Elvis proxy server is shipped with the Elvis server plug-in for Enterprise Server. This plug-in must be activated to be able to use the proxy. The proxy accepts a HTTP GET request and composes a REST request for Elvis Server. The response is streamed back to the caller. The proxy talks to the Elvis Server that is configured with the ELVIS_URL option in the Enterprise\/config\/config_elvis.php file. ## Web service integration This paragraph describes how a client application could integrate with the proxy. ### Determine the proxy base URL When the client does support the Elvis proxy, it should first check the `FeatureSet` in the `LogOnResponse`: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <FeatureSet> <Feature> <Key>ContentSourceProxyLinks_ELVIS<\/Key> <Value>http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/server\/plugins\/Elvis\/restproxyindex.php<\/Value> <\/Feature> <\/FeatureSet> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` If the `ContentSourceProxyLinks_ELVIS` feature is found, the client may assume the Elvis plug-in is activated. Else, it is deactivated and the proxy should not be used. The feature value provides the entry point of the proxy. This should be used by the client as a base URL to compose requests for the proxy. ### Request for preview For example, when the user clicks an image listed in the search results, the client requests for a preview as usual, but now it indicates that it supports the proxy by providing the `ContentSourceProxyLinks_ELVIS` item in the `RequestInfo`: ```xml <GetObjects> ... <IDs> <String>123<\/String> <\/IDs> <Lock>false<\/Lock> <Rendition>preview<\/Rendition> <RequestInfo> <String>ContentSourceProxyLinks_ELVIS<\/String> <\/RequestInfo> ... <\/GetObjects> ``` When the image is stored in Elvis, Enterprise provides the download URL as follows: ```xml <GetObjectsResponse> ... <Objects> <Object> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID>123<\/ID> ... <ContentSource>ELVIS<\/ContentSource> ... <\/BasicMetaData> ... <\/MetaData> ... <Files> <Attachment> ... <FileUrl xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> ... <ContentSourceFileLink xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <ContentSourceProxyLink>http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/server\/plugins\/Elvis\/restproxyindex.php?...<\/ContentSourceProxyLink> ... <\/Attachment> <\/Files> <\/Object> <\/Objects> <\/GetObjectsResponse> ``` ### Migration from direct links to proxy links When the client application is migrating `ContentSourceFileLink` to `ContentSourceProxyLink_ELVIS` and finds both options in the `LogOnResponse`, it should provide only the `ContentSourceProxyLink_ELVIS` option in `RequestInfo` of the `GetObjects` request. ## Proxy API This paragraph describes the API provided by Elvis proxy server. ### Request parameters Parameter | Meaning ---------------:|:---------------- ticket | *[Optional]* The Enterprise ticket obtained through the LogOn service response. Either the `ticket` or the `ww-app` parameter is required. When the client does not support cookies, this parameter can be used, but since the ticket often changes, the URLs won't be 'stable' <sup>1)<\/sup>. ww-app | *[Optional]* The client application name that was provided in the LogOn service request. Either the `ticket` or the `ww-app` parameter is required. This parameter can be used instead of the 'ticket' parameter to have 'stable' URLs <sup>1)<\/sup>. Note that when the client does not run in a web browser it should round-trip web cookies by itself. objectid | *[Required]* The ID of the workflow object in Enterprise. The object may reside in workflow or trash can. rendition | *[Required]* The file rendition to download. Supported values: 'native', 'preview' or 'thumb'. preview-args | *[Optional]* The preview- or cropping dimensions. See [Elvis Preview API](https:\/\/helpcenter.woodwing.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/115002690026) for details. > 1) **'Stable' URLs** have the following advantages: * Support for the web browser's cache. * Can be exchanged between users or client applications. * Can be embedded in a document. ### HTTP return codes The following HTTP codes may be returned: * HTTP 200: The file is found and is streamed back to caller. * HTTP 400: Bad HTTP parameters provided by caller. See above for required parameters. * HTTP 401: When ticket is no longer valid. This should be detected by the client to do a re-login. * HTTP 403: The user has no Read access to the invoked object in Enterprise or Elvis. * HTTP 404: The object could not be found in Enterprise or Elvis. * HTTP 405: Bad HTTP method requested by caller. Only GET, POST and OPTIONS are supported. * HTTP 500: Unexpected server error. ## Preview example When the `Foo Bar` client wants an Elvis image **preview** for object id `123`, the proxy can be called as follows: ``` http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/server\/plugins\/Elvis\/restproxyindex.php?ww-app=Foo%20Bar&objectid=123&rendition=preview&preview-args=maxWidth_600_maxHeight_400.jpg ``` The proxy will then resolve the Elvis Server URL, resolve the asset id from the object id and authorise the connection with Elvis credentials. In the example, the URL could be composed as follows: ``` http:\/\/localhost:18800\/preview\/6uk-q7GeKiD9yTAgKPsu6F\/previews\/maxWidth_600_maxHeight_400.jpg ``` In this example the Enterprise object id `123` is a shadow object for Elvis asset id `6uk-q7GeKiD9yTAgKPsu6F`. ## Crop example When the `Foo Bar` client wants an Elvis image **crop** for object id `123`, the proxy can be called as follows: ``` http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/server\/plugins\/Elvis\/restproxyindex.php?ww-app=Foo%20Bar&objectid=123&rendition=preview&preview-args=cropWidth_590_cropHeight_390_cropOffsetX_10_cropOffsetY_10.jpg ``` In this example, the result is the same as for the preview example above, but now a border of 10 pixels is removed (cropped).

        "title": "Web Service Interfaces",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Web Service Interfaces sortid: 40 permalink: 1036-web-service-interfaces --- This chapter describes all flavors of the Web Service interfaces exposed by Enterprise Server. For each flavor, its primary purpose is given as well as how it needs to be accessed by client applications. ## Flavors and their purposes Enterprise Server implements and exposes the following Web Service interfaces, each for a different purpose: ### Workflow interface This is the most advanced and heavily used interface of all. It defines all supported editorial workflow operations such as creating, saving and deleting files. Through this interface, editors and layout designers typically manage their articles, Dossiers, layouts, etc. This interface is called by all clients; InDesign, InCopy, Content Station and the Web Editor. ### Admin interface Used for various Brand- and user administration purposes, such as creating Publication Channels for Brands, creating users and assigning them to user groups, etc. These operations are only accessible to Brand- or system administrators. (With Enterprise Server 7.x the interface is not complete yet. For example, you cannot give users access to a Brand and you cannot set up a workflow definition. So, you can set up a basic Brand structure from scratch, but it requires manual completion.) The interface is mainly used by the admin web applications. It could also be very useful for third-party integrators, such as creating many Issues simultaneously for a specific Publication Channel. ### System Admin interface \\[since 9.0\\] Used for installation purposes and for technical administration (other than brand- or user administration). Note that the name of this interface does not imply that all its services require system admin access rights. For example, end-users in the workflow system can request which sub-applications are configured for them (when the Elvis Server plug-in is activated, this service tells whether or not the Elvis app should be shown in Content Station for the current user.) Candidate services that could appear in future include Feature Access Profiles, Server Plug-ins, Server Jobs, Server Options. ### Planning interface Through this interface, planning integrations with third-party systems are made, such as Journal Designer (DataPlan) and Timone (Tell). Its main goal is to simplify the workflow interface for plan systems and to offer some planning logics. Through this interface, planned pages and adverts (created in the planning system) are sent to the Enterprise database. InDesign is then able to automatically apply the planned information at the moment layouts are being opened. Planning systems create pages based on layout templates. ### Publishing interface Dossiers can be published to many channels through this interface. This is for instance used for Web CMS and SMS integrations (built with Server Plug-in technology). Previews of the published content can be requested. When content is outdated it can be unpublished to remove it from the channel again. This interface is mainly called by Content Station. ### Data Source interface Any external storage carrying structured catalog data can be integrated with Enterprise. Its data can be queried through this interface to gain centralized access for client applications. The storage itself can be any database flavor, comma-separated value lists, or any other data source. The data can represent anything, such as a product to appear in catalogs, or programs to appear in TV-listings. Enterprise Server implements the interface and requests Server Plug-ins (containing a DataSource connector) to establish a connection to the external storage and query its structured data. Smart Catalog Enterprise is required which calls the interface to query the structured data and automatically build any catalog on paper within InDesign. ## Definitions and entry points The table below can be used to look up definitions and entry points for all interface flavors. The second column shows the abbreviation (short name) used internally by Enterprise Server. For example, in the ...\/Enterprise\/server\/interfaces\/services and ...\/Enterprise\/server\/service folders you can find subfolders with such abbreviations. The third column shows three items of which their meaning is explained below the table. The last column shows the Enterprise version in which the interface was officially introduced. | interface | short | WSDL(1), URN (2), web service entry point (3) | since ------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|----------- | workflow | wfl | SCEnterprise.wsdl | 3.0 | | | urn:SmartConnection | | | | ...\/Enterprise\/index.php | | admin | adm | SmartConnectionAdmin.wsdl | 5.0 | | | urn:SmartConnectionAdmin | | | | ...\/Enterprise\/adminindex.php | | system admin | sys | SystemAdmin.wsdl | 9.0 | | | urn:SmartConnectionSysAdmin | | | | ..\/Enterprise\/sysadminindex.php | | planning | pln | SmartEditorialPlan.wsdl | 4.0 | | | urn:SmartEditorialPlan | | | | ...\/Enterprise\/editorialplan.php | | publishing | pub | EnterprisePublishing.wsdl | 6.0 | | | urn:EnterprisePublishing | | | | ...\/Enterprise\/publishindex.php | | data source | dat | PlutusDatasource.wsdl | 6.0 | | | urn:PlutusDatasource | | | | ...\/Enterprise\/datasourceindex.php | | admin data source | ads | PlutusAdmin.wsdl | 6.0 | | | urn:PlutusAdmin | | | | ...\/Enterprise\/datasourceadminindex.php | **(1) WSDL** The Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) is a document which defines an interface. This is the communication contract between client and server. It lists the server operations (Web Services) exposed to the clients and defines the SOAP data structure sent through client requests and received through server responses. The Enterprise WSDL files are located in the ...\/Enterprise\/server\/interfaces folder. This folder contains more WSDL files than listed in the table. Those are for internal use and should NOT be used for integrations. **(2) URN** The Uniform Resource Name is used to separate the interfaces from each other. For example, a User entity is defined for the workflow- and the admin interface. The one in the admin interface is more detailed. To avoid class name clashes, the URN is used as prefix, for example AdmUser. Only for the workflow interface, those prefixes are not applied (this is considered the \u2018main\u2019 flow which is mostly used). **(3) web service entry point** A PHP index file used by client applications to connect to. This can also be used to request the WSDL file, which is done as follows: index.php?wsdl. It is recommended to use this method and to parse the received WSDL file client-side. WSDL files should never be read from the ...\/Enterprise\/server\/interfaces folder because HTTP read access could be denied. But also, the server sets the soap:address element on-the-fly before sending the WSDL back to client. ## Inspecting client-server traffic Once you have read this guide in its entirety, you might wonder how operation sequences (should) take place, or what data structures are sent back and forth between clients and server. Playing with existing clients while server DEBUG logging is enabled could give you a quick starting point and allows you to examine the process that occurred. This could be helpful when you want to create a new client application from scratch, or let your client support new features that are exposed by a freshly released Enterpriser Server (or hook into running services by using Server plug-ins, which is out-of-scope for this guide). This section tells how this can be done. In the figure below a scenario is shown in which a user is working with any of the client applications, such as InDesign or Content Station. Whenever an action \\[1\\] is done that requires the help of the server, the client fires a Web Service request \\[2\\] to the server. After processing, the server returns the results through a Web Service response \\[3\\] back to the client. The client mostly gives some kind of reaction \\[4\\] informing the user that the operation was successful (or not) such as a dialog, a document that gets opened, or simply a spinning wheel that has stopped. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image11.png %}) Playing around is obviously not recommended to do on a production server. There can be cases though where you simply want to examine what happens on a very rich data set, typically a production or demo server. When you are not the only person working on that server, enabling system wide server logging logs all operations of all users. This cacophony of operations will blur the logging you are looking for, as fired by your client only. Therefore, improvements have been made in this area since Enterprise Server 8. ## Improved logging \\[since 8.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 8.0, logging can be enabled per client IP, and for each client IP a separate logging folder is created. (See DEBUGLEVELS option described in the Help Center how to configure.) You can add your client IP with a DEBUG value so that only for your client application all details are logged. The following steps show how to inspect the Web Services traffic: 1. Enable DEBUG logging on the server. (See DEBUGLEVELS option in the Help Center.) 1. Set the LOG\\_INTERNAL\\_SERVICES option to *true* in the configserver.php file. 1. Remove any existing logging from previous sessions. 1. Perform some actions, such as login, create document, check-in document, run a query, etc. 1. Have a look in the log folder. The Web Service requests and responses are logged, all in separate files. Request files have a \u201c\\_Req\u201d postfix and responses a \u201c\\_Resp\u201d postfix. For example, logging of a LogOn service call could look like this: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image12.png %}) The name of each HTML log file refers to the PHP file that was used to handle a Web Service or web application. In this case, the index\\_php.htm file refers to the index.php file. This PHP file can be looked up in *Definitions and entry points* and when found, it means that a Web Service was handled. In this case it is found that the workflow interface is used. When not found, it could be any of the web applications. The index\\_php.htm file contains all logging of the Web Service call handling, in this case the LogOn. The LogOn\\_SOAP\\_Req.xml file tells that the client has used the SOAP protocol for the LogOn request. The server returns the corresponding response (also in SOAP format) as logged in LogOn\\_SOAP\\_Resp.xml. Drag & drop them into a web browser (or XML editor) to view the structured data in readable format. Because the LOG\\_INTERNAL\\_SERVICES option is enabled, the WflLogOn\\_ Service\\_Req.txt and WflLogOn\\_Service\\_Resp.txt files are logged as well. This contains the data model of PHP that is built from the request or response. Note that clients could use old structures that are still supported by the new server (for backwards compatibility). The SOAP log contains the structure exactly how it was communicated between client and server (in either the old or the new structure). The TXT files contains only the new structure (old structure is mapped to new structure by the interface layer of the server). This is done to let the core server and the server plug-ins work with new structures only, and not to worry them with both structures (old and new). ## Notes Attached documents (DIME attachments) sent along with SOAP traffic are not logged server side. This is to avoid outrageous disk space consumption. InDesign\/InCopy clients support DIME logging though. ## Service validation \\[since 8.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 8 it is possible to validate Web Service requests and responses. This is implemented for all supported protocols and interfaces. This feature can be enabled with the SERVICE\\_VALIDATION option in the configserver.php file. It is recommended to enable it when you are developing a client that integrates with Enterprise. When a request is found to be invalid, this is a client bug and so please check the *SDK documentation* to fix the problem. When a response is not valid, it must be a server bug and so please report it to WoodWing Support. To continue your developments in the meantime, please add the path reported to be invalid at the SERVICE\\_VALIDATION\\_IGNORE\\_PATHS option in the configserver.php file to suppress the validation error. This allows you to keep the validation enabled, which is most important during development and tests. ## Understanding SOAP using a WSDL There are lots of published documents and books explaining all the ins- and outs of WSDLs in great detail. Much of the WSDL technology (features and options) is simply not used by Enterprise. As a starting point, this paragraph takes a login response (from the server SOAP log folder) as an example and explains how you can look up its data structure. This method can be applied to all client requests and server responses. In the following steps, used colors refer to the figure shown below: 1. Enable DEBUG logging.\\ (See the Help Center how to enable this.) 1. Login with client, which then fires a LogOn request, as logged on the server. 1. Open the SOAP log file, that can be found in the server log folder. 1. Determine the used **URN** `urn:SmartConnection` and look up the WSDL file (by using the table discussed in the previous chapter). In this example, you will find the SCEnterprise.wsdl file. 1. Determine the **operation** `<LogOnResponse>` (fired by the client) and use this as a starting point to look up the **parameters** `<Ticket>`, `<Publications>`, `...` and **data structure** `<PublicationInfo>` in the WSDL (as looked up). This is explained below in more detail. ```xml <?xml version=\u201d1.0\u201d encoding=\u201dUTF-8\u201d?> <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\u201dhttp:\/\/schemas...\/\u201d xmlns:xsi=\u201dhttp:\/\/www.w3.org\/...\u201d xmlns:xsi=\u201durn:SmartConnection\u201d> <SOAP-ENV:Body> <LogOnResponse> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Publications> <PublicationInfo> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>WW News<\/Name> ... <\/PublicationInfo> <\/Publications> ... <\/LogOnResponse> <\/SOAP-ENV:Body> <\/SOAP-ENV:Envelope> ``` Open the found SCEnterprise.wsdl file in a web browser and start reading from the bottom up. The type definitions can be looked up from the bottom up. All data structure items mentioned can be found this way: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image13.png %}) ```xml <complexType name=\"PublicationInfo\"> <all> <element name=\"Id\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Name\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> ... <\/all> <\/complexType> <complexType name=\"ArrayOfPublicationInfo\"> <sequence> <element name=\"PublicationInfo\" ... type=\"tns:PublicationInfo\"\/> <\/sequence> <\/complexType> <element name=\"LogOnResponse\"> <complexType> <sequence> <element name=\"Ticket\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Publications\" type=\"tns:ArrayOfPublicationInfo\" ...\/> ... <\/sequence> <\/complexType> <\/element> <message name=\"LogOnResponse\"> <part name=\"parameters\" element=\"tns:LogOnResponse\"\/> <\/message> <operation name=\"LogOn\"> <input message=\"tns:LogOn\"\/> <output message=\"tns:LogOnResponse\"\/> <\/operation> ``` ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Client Applications sortid: 50 permalink: 1029-client-applications --- The Web Service interfaces are accessible in different ways. The way to choose depends on the programming language used to develop your application and the way it needs to be deployed. Most common programming languages today support Web Services, including PHP, Java, RealBasic, VisualBasic, C++, C\\#, Flex and many more. Enterprise Server implements its interfaces with PHP. When your solution is written in a programming language other than PHP, you need to develop a client application that talks Web Services as specified by the WSDLs of Enterprise Server. Typically the WSDL file is read by your SOAP library\/tool to generate a proxy class (from its operations) and a bunch of data classes (from its type definitions). This way, you can build a request data structure based on the generated data classes, and fire the request through the proxy class by simply calling one of its methods (operations). The proxy takes care of building the SOAP request itself and parsing the returned SOAP response. In other terms, all SOAP challenges are encapsulated and hidden from your solution. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image14.png %}) Enterprise WSDLs refer to the DIME attachment specification to send documents along with SOAP traffic. DIME is required up to and including Enterprise Server 7.x. Since Enterprise Server 8.0 it is possible to move away from DIME and use the *Transfer Server* instead to send documents directly over HTTP. This is faster in execution and easier to integrate than DIME and therefore clients are encouraged to use the Transfer Server. When your solution is written in PHP, you can use helper classes shipped with Enterprise Server. When your solution -always- runs on the -same- server machine (as the Enterprise Server) you can use the *PHP service helper classes*. This way, your solution is executed by the very same process as the application server, as shown on the left side of the figure below. When it needs to be installed on other server machines though, you need the *PHP SOAP helper classes*. In this situation, whether it runs on the same(!) machine or not, your solution runs in a separate process, as shown on the right side of the figure below. In this case, there is a little overhead of SOAP traffic. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image15.png %}) ## .NET clients and Java clients using SOAP Enterprise Server 7.0 has changed the standard notation used for arrays in the WSDL files. (See also *Arrays*.) As a result, .NET and Java integrations could no longer use the WSDL files shipped with the server, and the array definitions needed to be manually changed back to the \u2018old\u2019 notation. For example, this was the \u2018old\u2019 notation used for Enterprise Server 6.0 (and older): ```xml <complexType name=\"ArrayOfUser\"> <sequence> <element name=\"User\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" type=\"tns:User\"\/> <\/sequence> <\/complexType> ``` while this is the \u2018new\u2019 notation used for Enterprise Server 7.0 (and later): ```xml <complexType name=\"ArrayOfUser\"> <complexContent> <restriction base=\"soap-enc:Array\"> <attribute ref=\"soap-enc:arrayType\" wsdl:arrayType=\"tns:User[]\"\/> <\/restriction> <\/complexContent> <\/complexType> ``` To solve this incompatibility, Enterprise Server 8.0 has introduced an option that automatically converts any requested WSDL file from the new into the old array notation on-the-fly. ## .NET clients When importing WSDL files in your .NET project, please add the ws-i value to the wsdl parameter to trigger that conversion, for example: `http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php?wsdl=ws-i` At the time of updating this document with Enterprise Server 8.0 info, a demo application is being developed in .NET showing how to integrate with Enterprise (which uses this conversion method). Once completed, the application will appear on Labs. ## Java clients Enterprise Server 8 makes it easier to integrate with Java clients. Java classes are generated from the WSDL and shipped in the SDK folder at the following location: `Enterprise\/sdk\/java\/src` This is done for all data structures (simpleType), requests and response classes. Whenever changes are made to the WSDL, regenerated classes are shipped with the server. Therefore make sure to reimport and compile the classes in your Java project to use the latest features. From Enterprise Server 8.3.2. \/ 9.0.2 onwards, essential fixes have been made to the Java classes shipped in the SDK folder. These fixes solve fatal errors in your Java client. For example: `org.xml.sax.SAXException: Invalid element in com.woodwing.enterprise.interfaces.services.wfl.PublicationInfo - PublicationInfo` The shipped Java classes with Enterprise Server 8.0.x, 8.1.x, 8.2.x, 8.3.0, 8.3.1, 9.0.0 and 9.0.1 cannot be used. For those versions it is needed to regenerate the classes yourself. That can be done with the WSDL2Java tool from Apache Axis: `java org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -u -W -p com.woodwing.enterprise.interfaces.services.wfl http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/index.php?wsdl=ws-i -o out` Note that the special `wsdl=ws-i` parameter triggers Enterprise Server to change the array definitions into WS-I notation for the requested WSDL (as explained earlier in this chapter). Support for this parameter is introduced in Enterprise Server 8.0. Earlier versions do not ship the Java classes, but you could generate them yourself as written above. For Enterprise Server 7.x you could copy the WSDLs and manually adjust all the array definitions (as explained earlier in this chapter) before you generate the Java classes. A \u201cHelloWorld\u201d sample application made in Java is available from *WoodWing Labs,* showing how to logon to Enterprise Server through the SOAP workflow interface by using the generated Java classes. Use this sample as a starting point. ## JavaScript clients using JSON \\[since 8.0\\] When developing a JavaScript client that integrates with Enterprise Server, JSON is the most suitable and recommended protocol to use. The basic concept is as follows: Some JavaScript functions can be built into an HTML web page. Instead of refreshing \/ reloading the entire page on user submits, the web page keeps loaded and the JavaScript functions communicate with the server in the background. Ajax technology is used to fire JSON RPC requests over HTTP to Enterprise Server. Technically this is done asynchronously to keep the web browser responsive while waiting for the server\u2019s response (but logically it could feel synchronous with the end-user waiting for a response too). When the response arrives, a registered callback function in JavaScript is triggered, which allows the client to continue its procedure. With all this in place, we speak of a JavaScript client application. All operations specified in any of the *Web Service Interfaces* can be used with JSON. But unlike SOAP, for JSON there are no request or data classes shipped. This is with a reason: It would lead into downloading all class definitions from server to client before the client can start talking. This significant overhead is something to avoid for the sake of performance (and there is no technical need to have such classes in place). The communication using JSON is very light weighted and data properties that are not known by client or server are simply not sent over HTTP. Basically, everything that is defined as nil \/ nullable can be simply left out (unlike SOAP that has to specify the property being set to nil) which reduces communication traffic. For example, this is how a LogOn request looks like: ```json { \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"LogOn\", \"params\":[{ \"User\":\"woodwing\", \"Password\":\"ww\", \"ClientName\":\"localhost\", \"ClientAppName\":\"my demo web app\", \"ClientAppVersion\":\"8.0\", \"RequestTicket\":true }], \"id\":2 } ``` On the server, arrived JSON classes are mapped onto PHP classes like done for SOAP. Therefore the client application should specify the class names so that Enterprise Server can do the mapping. (This is not needed for the request class itself since it is already specified in the \u201cmethod\u201d parameter the JSON RPC structure.) Enterprise Server expects the first property of an object to be named \u201c\\_\\_classname\\_\\_\u201d that caries the name of the data class (which is the same as the complexType as specified in the WSDL file). For example, the GetPagesInfo request takes an Issue and an Edition data classes, which therefore must be specified, as done by the red marked fragments: ```json { \"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"method\":\"GetPagesInfo\", \"params\":[{ \"Ticket\":\"c1a0844ep03hRxZAvy5SE7mGmBEsHHCTVBzVmAhC\", \"Issue\":{ \"__classname__\":\"Issue\", \"Id\":\"2\" }, \"IDs\":{}, \"Edition\":{ \"__classname__\":\"Edition\", \"Id\":\"1\" } }], \"id\":4 } ``` > At the time of updating this document with Enterprise Server 8.0 info, a demo application is being developed in JavaScript showing how to integrate with Enterprise with JSON (using jQuery). Once completed, the application will appear on Labs. Note that the demo client application includes some JavaScript modules that takes care of the low level communication details written above, except for the \u201c\\_\\_classname\\_\\_\u201d property that needs to be set by the client. Basically those classes can be used for any integration using the JSON RPC 2.0 standard. However, they are enriched with some error handling to simplify clients working with exception handling. Therefore, when developing your own client application, please copy the JavaScript classes included by the demo. You client application (HTML page) should have the very same web root location as Enterprise Server. For example, when the client application accesses the server through the \u201c*http:\/\/localhost\/enterprise\/index.php*\u201d entry point, then the client application should reside under the \"*http:\/\/localhost*\/\" web root as well. Doing so, Make sure the URL in your web browser address bar is -exactly- the same as the one used in jQuery.Zend.jsonrpc(...) in the example scripts. Note that even \u201clocalhost\u201d and \u201c127.0.0.1\u201d do NOT match. ## PHP clients using SOAP Especially for backend integrations PHP could be used to integrate Enterprise Server. It is possible to integrate with Enterprise Server \u2018internally\u2019 or \u2018externally\u2019. It is important to categorize your client in one of the two since it has a big impact on the whole solution. ***Internal PHP integrations*** are custom PHP modules triggered by a custom web application (or crontab) that include Enterprise Server directly, or Server Plug-ins that are included by Enterprise Server. They run within the very same PHP process as Enterprise Server. Therefore the integration does not need to run over an HTTP connection, which makes the integration easier to develop and faster in execution. ***External PHP integrations*** are custom stand-alone PHP client applications. Their PHP modules run at a server machine and they communicate to Enterprise Server over an HTTP connection. Therefore they are called *client* applications, seen from Enterprise Server point of view. The SOAP is the most obvious protocol to chose for such integrations. When it is needed to upload or download files to Enterprise Server, DIME can still be used but is no longer recommended. It is better to integrate the *Transfer Server* instead, which runs over another HTTP connection. ## Internal PHP integrations PHP data classes as well as service request- and response classes are generated from the WSDLs and shipped with Enterprise Server located in this folder: `...\/Enterprise\/server\/services\/<interface>` For example, this is how you can create a new user: ```php require_once( '...\/Enterprise\/config\/config.php' ); \/\/ TODO: Replace ... with web root folder! require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/secure.php'; require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/interfaces\/services\/adm\/DataClasses.php'; \/\/ AdmUser require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/services\/adm\/AdmCreateUsersService.class.php'; try { \/\/ Build new user in memory. $userObj = new AdmUser(); $userObj->Name = 'woodwing'; $userObj->FullName = 'WoodWing Software' $userObj->Deactivated = false; $userObj->Password = 'ww'; \/\/ Build service request to create a new user. $request = new AdmCreateUsersRequest(); $request->Ticket = '...'; \/\/ TODO: Fill-in your ticket here! (take it from LogOn) $request->RequestModes = array(); $request->Users = array( $userObj ); \/\/ Request Enterprise to create user in the database. $service = WW_DIContainer::get( AdmCreateUsersService::class ); \/\/ Since 10.7.0 $response = $service->execute( $request ); \/\/ $response is an AdmCreateUsersResponse object \/\/ Just display the user\u2019s DB id of the created user. echo $response->Users[0]->Id; } catch( BizException $e ) { echo $e->getMessage(); } ``` Basically, the whole pattern of calling services is always the same, no matter what service is called. First build a request object in memory and then execute the service by passing in the request. This returns a response object which can be used to validate or analyze the results. This is all shown in the example. The DataClasses.php file is included to define all PHP classes derived (generated) from the WSDL file, in this case SmartConnectionAdmin.wsdl. In the WSDL data classes are defined by so called complexType elements. In this case the complexType \u201cUser\u201d is of our interest. For each complexType a PHP data class is generated, which is listed in the DataClasses.php file. The PHP classes have a prefix to indicate the interface they originate from. (By exception, no prefixes are used for the workflow interface.) For this case Adm prefix is used, and so for the \u201cUser\u201d complexType a PHP class named \u201cAdmUser\u201d is generated. See *Definitions and entry points* to look up interfaces and prefixes. The \\$user variable represents the AdmUser object instance for which properties can be set. > It is a good habit *not* to list parameter values in the constructor, but to explicitly assign values to the created object\u2019s properties individually, as done in the example for Name, FullName, etc. The reason is that parameters might appear or disappear in the future, which might break your code when using constructors. When using properties, your code won\u2019t break. To create users, the WSDL specifies CreateUsersRequest and CreateUsersResponse elements. For those elements PHP classes are generated as well, and again prefixed, for this interface with Adm. By including the AdmCreateUsersService.class.php three classes are included at once:\\ AdmCreateUsersService, AdmCreateUsersRequest and AdmCreateUsersResponse. Those objects are used to execute the service. ### Changes since 10.7.0 Due to internal changes in the service, business and database layers of Enterprise Server, the way that services are loaded has changed. Loading services that are introduced since 10.7 and higher can only be achieved when using: `$service = WW_DIContainer::get( WflGetNamedQueriesService::class );` Services that existed before 10.7 can still be loaded with the old code (e.g. `$service = new WflGetNamedQueriesService();`) but is deprecated. Existing services can change in later versions and throw a PHP error. You are therefore encouraged to update your code to use the new syntax. If you have an integration that needs to support both pre-10.7 versions and 10.7 and higher you can use the following code to be backwards compatible: ```php $service = getServiceInstance( WflGetNamedQueriesService::class ); function getServiceInstance( $classname ) { if ( class_exists( 'WW_DIContainer' ) ) { return WW_DIContainer::get( $classname ); } return new $classname(); } ``` ## External PHP integrations For automatic data class mapping and DIME attachment support, Enterprise has extended PHP\u2019s SoapClient class with its WW\\_SOAP\\_Client class. For each interface flavor, another class is provided, such as WW\\_SOAP\\_AdmClient which communicates with the Administration interface. (See *Definitions and entry points* for the list of available interfaces.) These classes parameterize the WW\\_SOAP\\_Client class with the corresponding entry point and WSDL information, and map WSDL elements to PHP classes for programming convenience. All these classes can be found in this folder: `...\/Enterprise\/server\/protocols\/soap` The figure below shows how the classes inherit from each other, as displayed in the middle. On the left side, your PHP client code is calling any of the helper classes. On the right, the Enterprise Server is invoked through SOAP to execute a service. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image16.png %}) Some test modules in the ...\/Enterprise\/server\/wwtest folder use the SOAP helper classes from where you might want to take some useful code fragments: * workflow interface: speedtest.php * admin interface: adminservicetest.php * planning interface: clientplan.php * data source interface: datasourceservicetest.php Note that even for an external integration, you can still include classes from Enterprise Server without using Enterprise Server as a server. A good reason for that is to profit from the helper- and data classes to speed up your client developments. An example of a SOAP client application calling the admin interface (over HTTP), which is requested to create a new user and retrieve its database id: ```php require_once( dirname(__FILE__).'\/..\/..\/config\/config.php' ); try { $ticket = '...'; \/\/ TODO: Fill-in your ticket here! (take it from LogOn) \/\/ Build new user in memory. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/interfaces\/services\/adm\/DataClasses.php'; \/\/ AdmUser $userObj = new AdmUser(); $userObj->Name = 'woodwing'; $userObj->FullName = 'WoodWing Software'; $userObj->Deactivated = false; $userObj->Password = 'ww'; \/\/ Build service request to create a new user. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/interfaces\/services\/adm\/AdmCreateUsersRequest.class.php'; $request = new AdmCreateUsersRequest(); $request->Ticket = $ticket; $request->RequestModes = array(); $request->Users = array( $userObj ); \/\/ Request Enterprise to create user in the database. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/protocols\/soap\/AdmClient.php'; $soapClient = new WW_SOAP_AdmClient(); $response = $soapClient->CreateUsers( $request ); \/\/ Just display the user\u2019s DB id of the created user. echo 'Created user with DB id: '.$response->Users[0]->Id.'<br\/>'; } catch( SoapFault $e ) { echo $e->getMessage() . '<br\/>'; } catch( BizException $e ) { echo $e->getMessage() . '<br\/>'; } ``` ## External PHP integrations - stand alone The disadvantage of the helper- and data classes is, that you need to copy them from the Enterprise Server machine to your own server and keep them in sync. Alternatively you can use the PHP SoapClient class directly, but keep in mind that: * There is no support for file transfers. * There is no data class mapping done on the client side. This means you need to work with stdClass objects only. The same example as above, but now without any helper classes: ```php try { $ticket = '...'; \/\/ TODO: Fill-in your ticket here! (take it from LogOn) \/\/ Build new user in memory. $userObj = new stdClass(); $userObj->Name = 'woodwing'; $userObj->FullName = 'WoodWing Software'; $userObj->Password = 'ww'; \/\/ Build service request to create a new user. $request = new stdClass(); $request->Ticket = $ticket; $request->RequestModes = array(); $request->Users = array( $userObj ); \/\/ Request Enterprise to create user in the database. $soapClient = new SoapClient( 'http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/adminindex.php?wsdl', array( 'location' => 'http:\/\/localhost\/Enterprise\/adminindex.php', 'uri' => 'urn:SmartConnectionAdmin', 'soap_version' => SOAP_1_1, 'trace' => 1 )); $response = $soapClient->CreateUsers( $request ); \/\/ Just display the user\u2019s DB id of the created user. echo 'Created user with DB id: '.$response->Users[0]->Id.'<br\/>'; } catch( SoapFault $e ) { echo $e->getMessage() . '<br\/>'; } ``` ## External PHP integrations - with Transfer Server \\[since 8.0\\] For integrations with the *Transfer Server* a helper class in the utils folder is available named WW\\_Utils\\_TransferClient. This class can upload or download files to\/from the Transfer Server over HTTP. The example below illustrates how this helper class can be used. First an object is retrieved through the workflow interface with the GetObjects service call. The native file rendition is thereby requested. The 'transfer' =&gt; 'HTTP' option tells the server to use the Transfer Server (instead of DIME). As a result, the GetObjects response contains a URL to the Transfer Server to download the file. The WW\\_Utils\\_TransferClient utils class is used to download that native file. ```php require_once( dirname(__FILE__).'\/..\/..\/config\/config.php' ); require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/secure.php'; try { $ticket = '...'; \/\/ TODO: Fill-in your ticket here! (take it from LogOn) $objectId = '...'; \/\/ TODO: Fill-in the object id your want to download native file for! \/\/ Request for native file for an object. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/services\/wfl\/WflGetObjectsService.class.php'; $request = new WflGetObjectsRequest(); $request->Ticket = $ticket; $request->IDs = array( $objectId ); $request->Lock = false; $request->Rendition = 'native'; \/\/ Request Enterprise to create user in the database. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/protocols\/soap\/WflClient.php'; $options = array( 'transfer' => 'HTTP', 'protocol' => 'SOAP' ); $soapClient = new WW_SOAP_WflClient( $options ); $response = $soapClient->GetObjects( $request ); $attachment = $response->Objects[0]->Files[0]; \/\/ Download the native file from Transfer Server. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/utils\/TransferClient.class.php'; $transferClient = new WW_Utils_TransferClient( $ticket ); if( $transferClient->downloadFile( $attachment ) ) { echo 'Downloaded file successfully.<br\/>'; } else { echo 'ERROR: Failed downloading file.<br\/>'; } } catch( SoapFault $e ) { echo $e->getMessage() . '<br\/>'; } catch( BizException $e ) { echo $e->getMessage() . '<br\/>'; } ``` The example below shows roughly how to upload files. After doing so, the attachment can be passed to a CreateObjects or SaveObjects request. ```php try { $ticket = '...'; \/\/ TODO: Fill-in your ticket here! (take it from LogOn) \/\/ Build a native image attachment in memory. $attachment = new Attachment(); $attachment->FilePath = '\/full\/path\/to\/my\/native\/image\/file.jpg'; \/\/ TODO: adjust $attachment->Rendition = 'native'; $attachment->Type = 'image\/jpeg'; \/\/ Upload the image file to the Transfer Server folder. require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/utils\/TransferClient.class.php'; $transferClient = new WW_Utils_TransferClient( $ticket ); $transferClient->uploadFile( $attachment ); \/\/ TODO: Call CreateObjects or SaveObjects } catch( BizException $e ) { echo $e->getMessage() . '<br\/>'; } ``` ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Shared Concepts sortid: 60 permalink: 1033-shared-concepts --- This chapter describes concepts used in all Web Service interfaces. ## WSDL Each interface is described with a separate WSDL. The WSDL v1.1 specification distinguishes between two message styles: document and RPC. Furthermore there are different serialization formats, with SOAP encoding and literal being the two popular serialization formats today. The WSDLs shipped with Enterprise Server all use the document message style with literal encoding, also known as document\/literal. ## Attachments The Web Service interfaces use XML messages through an HTTP connection. Any files transferred are sent through SOAP attachments with DIME being used to encapsulate this into a single data stream. The SOAP message itself and the attachments are all encapsulated by DIME. To handle a DIME request or response, the DIME must be parsed to be able to access the SOAP message itself. There are only a few Web Services that transfer files, which is limited to the workflow- and planning interfaces. Those can be recognized by the *dime:message* element shown for the few operations in the WSDL, for example: ```xml <operation name=\"CreateObjects\"> <soap:operation soapAction=\"urn:SmartConnection#CreateObjects\"\/> <input> <dime:message layout=\"http:\/\/schemas.xmlsoap.org\/ws\/2002\/04\/dime\/closed-layout\" wsdl:required=\"false\"\/> <soap:body use=\"literal\"\/> <\/input> <output> <soap:body use=\"literal\"\/> <\/output> <\/operation> ``` Note that the *input* element stands for the SOAP request fired by the client and the *output* element for the SOAP response returned by the server. The fragment above tells us that the CreateObjects operation (Web Service to upload documents) accepts DIME attachments, but that none are returned, which makes sense. For more information on SOAP attachments, see [here](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/soap12-af\/). For more information on DIME encapsulation, see [here](http:\/\/www.watersprings.org\/pub\/id\/draft-nielsen-dime-soap-01.txt). Since Enterprise Server 8.0, it is recommended to use the *Transfer Server* instead of DIME. For both technologies, the DIME definitions in the WSDLs specify what service requests or responses can deal with file attachments. ## Errors A SOAP *Fault* is returned to clients when an error has occurred server-side during any Web Service execution. For example: ```xml <SOAP-ENV:Envelope> <SOAP-ENV:Body> <SOAP-ENV:Fault> <faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Client<\/faultcode> <faultstring>Access denied (S1002)<\/faultstring> <faultactor\/> <detail>1661(C)<\/detail> <\/SOAP-ENV:Fault> <\/SOAP-ENV:Body> <\/SOAP-ENV:Envelope> ``` When the *faultcode* is set to Client it means that the caller has somehow passed wrong parameters or tries to do something that is against the rules. When set to Server it means that the server is not \u2018willing\u2019 to process the operation or has an internal error. It is a rough indication who might have caused the error: Client or Server. Typically used for debugging. The *faultstring* is a localized string that can be directly shown to the user. The server error code is attached to this message in \u201c(Sxxxx)\u201d format. Clients that need to know what error occurred, should parse this error code, for example by taking the code 1002 in the given example. Clients sometimes know better what happened than the server, especially when firing many requests to establish one logical heavy operation. They are free to interpret the error code and display other messages (other than the ones returned to the client) to help the user understand what happened. The 1000-1999 range is reserved for operational errors; the 2000-2999 range is reserved for license errors. Depending on the fault, a *detail* message can also be provided by the server to pass on extra information. The detail message is not localized and mostly cryptical, so it should never be shown to end users. In the given example, the server informs that the requested operation was performed for an object (ID=1661), for which the user has has no Change Status (C) access rights. Clients could try to parse this, but its format is free and subject to change. So, it is not recommended and should be used only in exceptional cases. For example, the server can add tokens as well to the *detail* message; for example in case an invalid ticket is passed (perhaps because it is expired) a fault is returned with *detail* message set to \u201cSCEntError\\_InvalidTicket\u201d. This should be checked by clients to determine if there is a need to raise the re-logon dialog. ## Tickets Most Web Services require a ticket as input parameter. This ticket is obtained from the LogOn operation. The LogOn operation validates the user name and password and returns a ticket when the user account is valid. The ticket is used by clients for subsequent requests. Tickets are interchangeable between all interfaces. By default, a logon\/ticket session expires within 24 hours (or 1 hour for web clients). Whenever a request with a valid ticket arrives, the server resets its expiration timer for that session. As long as requests are fired before the expiration ends, clients are able to continue working, thereby keeping one license seat occupied. When a ticket has expired, an error is returned and the client needs to re-logon obtaining a new\/different ticket. At this point, the clients risks that the last seat was taken in the meantime. When the very same user does logon with the very same client application, but from a different location (IP address), the server assumes the user has moved. And so, the ticket from the first application is made invalid. This is to avoid accidentally keeping two license seats occupied for the whole day. ### Cookie based tickets Since Enterprise Server 10.2.0 it is possible to omit the ticket in the operation payload. When executing a LogOn operation the server will return the ticket as an cookie as well as in the content of the response. When the client has support for cookies (implemented a \u2018cookie jar\u2019), then the cookies are round tripped with every request to the server. A cookie is set per AppName in the LogOn request. This allows multiple cookies to be set in the same cookie container for different clients. This occurs for example when you have multiple clients running in the same browser instance. For the server to select the correct cookie it needs to know the AppName that is sending the request. A client can send this information by adding a special HTTP header to the request: `X-WoodWing-Application: <App Name as given in the LogOn response>` If the client can\u2019t add the header for the request, a HTTP GET parameter can be added to the URL. This can occur for example when you want to load an image directly from the Transfer Server in an HTML img tag. `http:\/\/123.123.123.123\/transferindex.php?...&ww-app=<AppName>` Note that this feature is just an addition to Enterprise Server. The ticket given in the request body will be supported side-by-side. ## Services Unlike the stored information in the database, Enterprise Server itself is stateless. Every requested service runs on its own. When one service depends on another service, typically resulting data from one is passed on to the other. For example, an object id returned through a search query can be used to open the object file for editing. Each service intends to represent one user operation. In other terms, when a user performs one action, there should be just one service executed only. This is needed for two reasons: * **Performance** - Think of a slow connection with one second network overhead. Performing five requests will require five seconds extra wait time, which is unacceptable. * **Architecture** - One service representing one logical action implies the need of passing all information to execute the service. This makes it possible to interpret the intention of the operation, which is why it is a good thing to develop custom solutions using Server Plug-ins hooking into Web Services. However, in some cases multiple services are called by client applications, trigged by one logical action. For example, when a user logs in, Content Station typically requests to execute the inbox query immediately after, to show objects assigned to that user. Such scenarios are valid since running a query is a totally different logical operation than the login. Client applications can wait for each service to complete and then fire a next request. This synchronous communication method works well but is far from optimal. Calling services asynchronously is allowed by Enterprise Server and can significantly speed up end user wait times. Content Station does this (by running multiple threads). Obviously, this can be done when there are no specific dependencies between services (as mentioned above). ## Arrays One of the most often used structures in SOAP is the array. It allows transferring many of the same entities (objects, relations, pages, etc.) in a list through requests and responses. The way arrays must be formatted is specified in the WSDL. For Enterprise, those definitions are always prefixed with `ArrayOf` followed by the entity name. For example: ```xml <complexType name=\"ArrayOfPlacement\"> <sequence> <element name=\"Placement\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" type=\"tns:Placement\"\/> <\/sequence> <\/complexType> ``` It tells SOAP messages using this type that zero to many `Placement` elements are allowed. The elements must be structured as follows: ```xml <Placements> <Placement> ... <\/Placement> <Placement> ... <\/Placement> <\/Placements> ``` \\[Since 7.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 7.0 this notation has been changed to meet new standards with better support of SOAP tools. The definition has been changed in such a way that the old notation (usage) is still supported though: ```xml <complexType name=\"ArrayOfPlacement\"> <complexContent> <restriction base=\"soap-enc:Array\"> <attribute ref=\"soap-enc:arrayType\" wsdl:arrayType=\"tns:Placement[]\"\/> <\/restriction> <\/complexContent> <\/complexType> ``` This tells the same as before, but now a new notation can be used too: ```xml <Placements SOAP-ENC:arrayType=\"ns1:Placement[]\" xsi:type=\"SOAP-ENC:Array\"> <item> ... <\/item> <item> ... <\/item> <\/Placements> ``` Basically, the parent `Placements` attributes says that its child `item` elements are actually `Placement` elements. Content Station 7.x uses this technique, while Smart Connection 7.x for InDesign \/ InCopy still use the \u2018old\u2019 method. ## User access rights One of the keystones of the Enterprise workflow system is support for user access rights. Whenever an end user tries to do something for which no access is granted, and \u201cAccess denied (S1002)\u201d error is raised. This should be determined by the server only and not by client applications. In such a case, the server returns a SOAP fault (see *Errors*). Such an error is shown in a dialog that is raised by client applications. ### Enabling vs disabling access Access rights are defined through Access Profiles. (See the Help Center for information about how to configure these.) Access feature options can be selected, which means they are enabled. However, when not selected, it does not(!) disable the feature; it only means that the feature is not enabled in this particular access profile, so you are not blocking access or something like that. A user has no access for a certain feature if there is no profile found with the corresponding option selected. For this reason, it is recommended to split options through many profiles and enable just a few. (This instead of having all enabled and disabling a few.) Else you might find yourself wondering why an end user has gained access unexpectedly. ### Interpreting access definitions When the end user performs a login action to the system, the server returns the configured profile definitions (through the LogOnResponse -&gt; FeatureProfiles element) made by the admin user that are relevant for the end user. Only access options that have no default value are returned. You can determine the defaults by creating a new Access Profile through the admin pages and see which ones are selected. (At least up to Enterprise Server 7.0 all options are selected by default, with the exception of the \u201cForce Track Changes\u201d option.) Let\u2019s say that the system admin creates one Access Profile, clears the \u201cCreate Dossiers\u201d option and names it \u201cno Dossier creation\u201d. The definition in the login response will look as follows: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <FeatureProfiles> <FeatureProfile> <Name>no Dossier creation<\/Name> <Features> <AppFeature> <Name>CreateDossier<\/Name> <Value>No<\/Value> <\/AppFeature> <\/Features> <\/FeatureProfile> ... <\/FeatureProfiles> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` Note that the \u201cCreate Dossiers\u201d is a localized term. To uniquely identify this access feature, internal keys are used (in this case *CreateDossier)*. Those keys can be used by client applications to look up and interpret. For example, a client application implementing a Create Dossier operation could check for this specific key. With the definition available, the Brand admin can use it to give the end user access to the Brand in the Authorization Maintenance admin page. Let\u2019s say that the Brand admin has given the end user access to the WW News Brand through the \u201cno Dossier creation\u201d profile (for all statuses and all Categories). When the end user performs a login action, this configuration is reflected in the login response too (through Publications -&gt; PublicationInfo -&gt; FeatureAccessList element). See the figure below. The profile name (the text marked in red in the figure below) refers to the profile definition (the text marked in red in the figure above). This way clients can look up definitions. Because the Brand admin user has configured for all statuses and all Categories, respectively *State* and *Section* elements are not provided (*xsi:nil* attribute set to \u201ctrue\u201d). Nil typically means no specific item configured, which implies all options. (Note that Category was formerly named Section.) When configured, an id is filled in for those elements. When access rights are configured for an Issue with the \u201cOverrule Brand\u201d option enabled, the *Issue* element is used to pass its id. *Note: the Overrule Brand option is no longer supported from Enterprise Server 10.7.0 onwards.* ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <Publications> <PublicationInfo> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>WW News<\/Name> ... <FeatureAccessList> <FeatureAccess> <Profile>no Dossier creation<\/Profile> <Issue xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <Section xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <State xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <\/FeatureAccess> <\/FeatureAccessList> <\/Publications> <\/PublicationInfo> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` #### Changes since 10.7.0 Since Enterprise Server 10.7.0 the PublicationInfo and FeatureAccess list can also be requested via specific API calls. The WflGetPublications service can be used to get the PublicationInfo objects and the WflGetAuthorizations service can be used to get the FeatureProfile objects. For backwards compatibility the information is also returned in the LogOnResponse when explicitly requested in the RequestInfo. ### Disabling GUI items For user convenience, the client application GUI can be enhanced by hiding\/disabling operations that are expected to always fail for a specific context. For example, when the user is not allowed to create Dossiers at all, no matter what, the client application could disable the \u201cCreate Dossier\u201d operation in its GUI (such as context menus). Nevertheless, this must be done with great care. When disabling is done too rigidly it could accidentally withhold users from doing operations that they are allowed to. This can be implemented by interpreting the login response, specifically the two areas mentioned in the examples above. When the user is working in the context of the WW News Brand (for example selected in the GUI) the client needs to check all the profiles for that Brand (by looking up the profile definitions as explained above). If none of them gain access to the *CreateDossier* feature, it is safe to disable the \u201cCreate Dossier\u201d operation in the GUI. If the context of the Brand is undetermined (for example global view on the system) all profiles (of all Brands) need to be checked. When the currently selected Issue (if any) has the Overrule Brand option set, only the configurations made for the Issue should be checked (and the configurations for its Brand should be ignored!). ### Overruling access rights When normal configurations made through admin pages do not fulfill the customer\u2019s needs, Server Plug-ins could be the answer. Its connectors allow you to hook into any workflow service. See the Server Plug-ins documentation for more info. When any operation is not allowed, the connector could throw a BizException as follows: ```php throw new BizException( 'ERR_AUTHORIZATION', 'Server', '' ); ``` For example, it could check if the end user is member of a specific user group, it could check the status of the object involved, it could check the deadline and system time, etc, and then decide to block access.

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Messages sortid: 70 permalink: 1031-messages --- Web Services are initiated by clients and executed by the server. But there is more. Halfway a service execution, the server can fire a message. It does this for all kind of events. The messages are pushed to any of the clients that are listening. The messaging system of Enterprise is built on network broadcasting or multicasting. That works for LAN only. Since Enterprise Server 10.0 there is a message queue integration with RabbitMQ that allows messages to travel over WAN. This chapter describes the format of all messages sent by Enterprise Server. This is typically useful when you develop you own client application and you want to receive and interpret such messages. Note that the Enterprise client applications do exactly the same, implementing the following Enterprise features: - Hot Inbox - User Messaging - Live Update ## Message format for broadcasting \/ multicasting A message is always related to a single object (or user). They consist of a header followed by multiple data fields (properties). The following format is respected: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image17.png %}) The following table describes the tokens used in the picture: | **token** | **type** | **description** | --------------| -------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | format | uint8 | Version number of this format, which might change in the future. Should be set to 1 | | | which is the current version. | event | uint8 | Identifier of message type. Implies which fields are listed.

Integer respects Big Endian notation. | field id | UTF8 string | Unicode string in UTF-8 notation. Contains the value of the field identifier. These IDs should match field names returned from database queries. Therefore, a new element is introduced in the Property element of WSDL to make difference between localized and unlocalized property names. If the field ID matches one of the Name elements, its value is updated. | value len | uint16 | Length in bytes of (escaped) field value. Integer respects Big Endian notation. | value | UTF8 string | Unicode string in UTF-8 notation. Contains the value of the field value. All types of fields are transformed to string notation Because messages are broadcasted, the total package size of a single message should NOT exceed the ethernet frame size, typically 1500 bytes. If fields don\u2019t fit in a message, they are ignored and the message is sent without them ## Events The following shows all supported events and their messages: | **ID** | **Action** | **Since** |

Query update id, returned as UpdateID in NamedQueryResponse. Note that the standard Enterprise Server version 6 and higher does not implement this, it\u2019s only supported by Content Station version 6 and higher for custom content sources. 6. (no longer in use) 7. UserId is a full name (Enterprise Server 6.0 and higher) that defines the user that initiated the action. 8. Supported by Content Station to allow Content Sources to trigger a re-logon when queries are added\/removed. Note that the standard Enterprise Server version 6 and higher does not implement this, it\u2019s only supported by Content Station version 6 and higher for custom content sources. 9. Instead of sending the actual ticket, the first 12 characters of the MD5 hash of the ticket are sent. 10. The Dossier IDs are sent in a binary package of uint32 numbers (so each ID takes 4 bytes). The whole package is base-64 encoded. For the Feed Publisher, the IDs are grouped by \u2018sections\u2019, for which zero (id=0) is used as a section marker. For DPS, all Dossiers (IDs) are sent that are assigned to an Issue (so a specific sort per Edition\/Device is not supported). When there are too many Dossiers to fit into 1K package, the DossierIds field is not sent at all. This is an indication to clients (such as Content Station) to start polling Issue orders instead (through Web services). 11. specific fields. There can be additional fields depending on the Publishing integration. For example: for the Adobe DPS integration there is one field named \u2018PublishStatus\u2019 for all issue events. 12. Only sent when the message is set to \u201cRead\u201d. 13. Labels are comma-separated and each label consists of an id and a name attribute separated by a tab: `id\\tname` 14. The Description and Subject fields are purposely put at the end of the message; For n-casting (broadcasting \/ multi-casting), when fields are too long to fit into the message, they will be left out entirely. 15. IssueIdsOrder is an array of issue IDs in configured order. For n-casting (broadcasting \/ multi-casting), when there are many issue IDs, the server will split-up the IDs over multiple network packages. Those packages may overtake each other underway and arrive in random order. There is no information for clients to put them in the right order again. Therefore this message should not be implemented for n-casting client side. For RabbitMQ there is no such problem and so this is the recommended protocol. 16. An issue could be activated or de-activated. Only activated issues should be shown in the UI for end-users. Clients should check the Activated flag for this. 17. If the client does not support Overrule Issues (such as Content Station) all issue events for which the OverrulePublication flag is set should be ignored. 18. The CreateIssue event is not supported for Overrule Issues (issues having the OverrulePublication flag set) because client applications would then need the entire workflow setup which is only provided through a logon response. The ModifyIssue and DeleteIssue events are sent out for normal issues and Overrule Issues. 19. Some of the provided web services are asynchronous (such as the CreateObjectRelationsAsync service). A service is made asynchronous as it may require significant processing time. This way, HTTP connections are kept open for a very limited amount of time. Therefore an asynchronous web service does not execute work in direct context of the client application's HTTP request. Instead, it pushes a new server job in the queue and immediately returns an `OperationId`. When the job has support for a progress indication, it periodically updates its progress in its job record but also sends out a message with progress info. (If there is no such support, the job processor sends a message once the entire job is finished.) This enables the client application to show a progress indicator for the end user waiting for the operation to complete. A progress message includes an `OperationId` field to enable the client application to recognize the operation it has initiated. As failed jobs may be retried, the progress indicator may be reset to zero to let the job show its progress again. When a job execution was successful or when it has failed too many times and was given up, the progress will be set to 100 to let the client application retrieve the service results through a subsequent web service. This could be either a successful response or an error. 20. As the server job is working on the offloaded operation in the background, the Ticket will *not* be the same as the ticket of the client application that initiated the job. ## RabbitMQ integration \\[since 10.0\\] ### Basic flow When a user performs a workflow operation, the client calls a web service. The server executes the service and when completed it sends out an event message to all other clients. For this, the server integrates with RabbitMQ. It sends the message to an exchange (of type \u2018fanout\u2019) in RabbitMQ. The exchange distributes this message to all queues that are bound to the exchange. All clients that are continuously listening for the message queues receive the message and update the properties shown in their UI with the received information. ### Setup in RabbitMQ For each Enterprise installation connected to RabbitMQ, a virtual host is created. For the name of the virtual host, the Enterprise System ID is used. For each brand in Enterprise, an exchange is created in RabbitMQ. For each client logged in to Enterprise, a queue is created in RabbitMQ. The exchanges and queues are created for a specific virtual host. Users are created system wide (prefixed with the Enterprise System ID). If a user has view access to a brand in Enterprise, a binding is created between the queue and the exchange. For each Enterprise installation, one admin user is configured for RabbitMQ. For each virtual host (so each Enterprise installation) one exchange is created for sending system events. All clients logged in to Enterprise have a binding to this exchange. ### Access rights Users only have access to one virtual host. For each client they are logged in to, one queue can be accessed only. Users have no access to exchanges nor to queues that belong to other users. This implicitly blocks the creation of additional bindings that would give access to other queues. Only those messages will arrive in the user\u2019s queues that originate from the brands the user has access to. ### Overrule issues Issues that have the Overrule Brand option enabled are much the same as regular brands: for both setups a workflow can be configured including access rights. Therefore wherever \u2018brand\u2019 is mentioned in this chapter, this includes overrule issues. *Note: the Overrule Brand option is no longer supported from Enterprise Server 10.7.0 onwards.* ### On logon, server prepares RabbitMQ When the user logs in to Enterprise, Enterprise Server creates the following resources in RabbitMQ (except when these already exist): - a virtual host (using the Enterprise System ID) - the user (using the user id prefixed with the Enterprise System ID) - the exchanges the user has access to (using the brand ids and overrule issue ids) - one message queue - bindings between the queue and the exchanges The user password will be reset in RabbitMQ to make sure it matches with the Enterprise password. For each queue the user permissions are set. In the LogOnResponse, the server provides the configured connections to RabbitMQ and the name of the message queue. This tells the clients how to connect and subscribe for messages. Assumed is that the client applies the same password for RabbitMQ as it used for Enterprise. ### On logon, client subscribes for messages After a successful logon, the clients looks up the message queue from the LogOnResponse. Only one message queue exists. In the MessageQueueConnections, the clients look up connections that have Instance set to \u201cRabbitMQ\u201d and Protocol set to the one they support, such as \u201cAMQP\u201d, \u201cSTOMP\u201d or \u201cSTOMPWS\u201d. Note that AMQP has a better performance than STOMP. Next, the client connects to RabbitMQ and logs on the current user. It does this by taking the User name from the connection while the password is taken from the logon dialog because assumed is that the password is the same as used for Enterprise. Once logged in, the clients subscribe for the message queue found in the logon response and provide a callback function. ### On event, server publishes messages At the end of a workflow web service execution, the server decides to trigger an event. When RabbitMQ is enabled, it connects to the RabbitMQ server using the configured admin account for the AMQP protocol. For object related events, it resolves the brand or overrule issue to determine the corresponding exchange. Else it uses the system event exchange. Then, using JSON, it encodes the properties to be sent and publishes the composed message to RabbitMQ exchange. The exchange (of type \u2018fanout\u2019) distributes the message to all bound message queues. ### On event, client receives messages When a message arrives in the queue, RabbitMQ sends it to all subscribers. On arrival, the callback function is called by the client library. The clients should decode the JSON message and check if the EventId is of their interest. They may expect the properties to be present as specified in the \u201cEvents\u201d paragraph in this chapter. For object related events, they may want to update the object properties listed in the UI (by using the object id as a reference). For example, this could be done for the object properties listed in the search results of the client tab or panel. ### On logoff, client should unsubscribe When the user logs out (or quits the client), the client should unsubscribe from all the message queues. Removing the queues is done by the server and should not be done by the clients. ### Ticket expiration and subscriptions When the ticket expires, the message queues will be cleaned up by the server. (This cleanup may happen at the moment another user logs on.) When losing the connection with the message queue, clients should keep this in mind. When the queue no longer exists, client should show the re-logon dialog. (When client is in the process of logging out, this dialog should be suppressed.) ### RabbitMQ info in the logon response The server takes full responsibility for creating the resources in RabbitMQ. This makes it easy for the clients to integrate with RabbitMQ. Although this chapter explains how the server creates the virtual host, exchanges, queues and bindings, clients should never try to understand nor try to mimic, compose or parse those resource names. Instead, clients should read all information from the logon response instead. The name of the message queue the client should subscribe for, should be looked up in the logon response in the following location: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <MessageQueue>...<\/MessageQueue> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` The connections to RabbitMQ are set up in the MESSAGE\\_QUEUE\\_CONNECTIONS option in the configserver.php file. Those connections are communicated to the clients through the logon response as well. The client should check for any connection that has Instance set to \u201cRabbitMQ\u201d and Protocol set to the one they support. The connections in the response are listed as follows: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <MessageQueueConnections> <MessageQueueConnection> <Instance>RabbitMQ<\/Instance> <Protocol>AMQP<\/Protocol> <Url>amqps:\/\/localhost:5671<\/Url> <User>d0d9edc5-17b3-4284-fa90-af4dd2b7a551.1<\/User> <Password xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <VirtualHost>d0d9edc5-17b3-4284-fa90-af4dd2b7a551<\/VirtualHost> <\/MessageQueueConnection> <MessageQueueConnection> <Instance>RabbitMQ<\/Instance> <Protocol>STOMPWS<\/Protocol> <Url>wss:\/\/localhost:15673\/ws<\/Url> <User>d0d9edc5-17b3-4284-fa90-af4dd2b7a551.1<\/User> <Password xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <VirtualHost>d0d9edc5-17b3-4284-fa90-af4dd2b7a551<\/VirtualHost> <\/MessageQueueConnection> ... <\/MessageQueueConnections> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` ### JSON message structure The messages used for RabbitMQ integration are JSON encoded and have the following format: ```json { \"EventHeaders\": { \"EntVersion\": \"10.0.0\", \"EventId\": \"1\" } \"EventData\": { \"FullName\": \"WoodWing Software\", \"Server\": \"Enterprise\", \"Ticket\": \"37ed7620558e\", \"UserID\": \"woodwing\" } } ```",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Objects and Metadata sortid: 010 permalink: 1056-objects-and-metadata --- Enterprise manages workflow objects. The way objects are treated strongly depends on the object type. For example, an article is an Object for which the type is set to Article. By knowing the type, specific business rules are triggered, such as whether an object is placeable, if it can be placed multiple times, on which other object type it can be placed, etc. Once an object is created, its type can never change. The complete list of supported types can be found in the WSDL in the ObjectType definition. One of them is the Other type, which is especially useful for system integrators introducing foreign object types that do not look like any of the standard supported types and need no special treatment by Enterprise itself. For example, custom Server Plug-ins (or SOAP clients) could check for this type and do something fancy with the object, such as unzipping a ZIP file and dynamically create objects from the files found inside. ## Formats Note that different formats (technical types) are supported per object type. For example for Article objects, the following formats are commonly used: InCopy, plain text, RTF, Word and Excel. For formats, MIME content types are used (see http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Protocols\/rfc1341\/4\\_Content-Type.html). Common format types used in Enterprise are: - application\/incopy - application\/indesign - image\/jpeg - image\/tiff - application\/pdf - application\/postscript - application\/msword - application\/rtf - text\/richtext - text\/plain ## Object IDs Each object has an ID to uniquely identify the object within the Enterprise system. The object ID is typically numeric, but it can also be any string (which is sometimes done by (Content Source) integrations such as Fotoware). Strings are allowed, as long they can be used as a folder name on Mac OSX and Windows, which is required by Enterprise clients. ## Status An object is always in exactly one workflow status at the same time. This tells which workflow definition the object is following. The workflow is set up through the Brand Maintenance admin pages (see the Admin Guide for details.) A status depends on the object type; when there is no status configured for an article object, articles cannot be created. A status has an ID which is unique within the whole system. Personal statuses have the ID set to -1 (regardless of the user or object type). Those special statuses are recognized by the system and treated differently; they are not stored in the database (unlike normal statuses) and are created on-the-fly which makes users think they truly exist. A status has a localized name and a color configured, which both have no meaning for the system at all. A sequence number is used to order statuses shown in lists. ## Object properties Along with each object, metadata is stored. It consists of a pre-defined set of properties to which custom properties can be added. Metadata is structured differently depending on the context of usage, as explained in the following paragraphs. ### Metadata services When end users are retrieving, creating or saving objects (or setting properties), metadata properties are put in a hierarchical tree. This tree structure can also hold entities, such as a status which contains the id, name, etc. (see fragment below). The entity data is assumed to be read-only when passed along with objects. Typically it is the server returning such data for client convenience. All of this gets ignored when it is passed back by the clients to the server, except for the id. Ids are referring to entity instances stored in the database, so when the ids are changed during an object save operation (SaveObjects), the server will update references made from the object to the entity instances stored in the database. ```xml <Object> <MetaData> ... <WorkflowMetaData> ... <State> <Id>257<\/Id> <Name>For Review<\/Name> <Type>Article<\/Type> <Produce xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <Color>#666633<\/Color> <DefaultRouteTo xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <\/State> ... <\/WorkflowMetaData> ... <\/MetaData> <\/Object> ``` The format of properties and entities (such as the *State*) can be looked up in the WSDL (see the fragment below). For example, the status name is a *string*. ```xml <complexType name=\"State\"> <all> <element name=\"Id\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Name\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Type\" type=\"tns:ObjectType\"\/> <element name=\"Produce\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"> <element name=\"Color\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"tns:Color\"\/> <element name=\"DefaultRouteTo\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` Custom properties are sent in list format (through MetaData -&gt; ExtraMetaData) as shown in the fragment below. Their names are prefixed with \u201cC\\_\u201d. Regardless of the configured data type, the current value(s) is always a list of strings. ```xml <Object> <MetaData> ... <ExtraMetaData> <ExtraMetaData> <Property>C_IS_MY_HAIR_OK<\/Property> <Values> <String>No<\/String> <\/Values> <\/ExtraMetaData> ... <\/ExtraMetaData> <\/MetaData> <\/Object> ``` ### Query services When users perform a search query, the properties are returned in rows and columns. Such properties (sent through QueryObjects and NamedQuery services) are formatted using the very same structure elements (such as *Property* and *Row*). For entity elements the element name itself represents the name. Its elements are concatenated. For example, the status name is *State* and the status id is *StateId*, as shown in the following fragment: ```xml <QueryObjectsResponse> <Columns> ... <Property> <Name>State<\/Name> <DisplayName>Status<\/DisplayName> <Type>list<\/Type> <\/Property> <Property> <Name>StateId<\/Name> <DisplayName>Status ID<\/DisplayName> <Type>string<\/Type> <\/Property> ... <\/Columns> <Rows> <Row> ... <String>For Review<\/String> <String>257<\/String> ... <\/Row> ... <\/Rows> <\/QueryObjectsResponse> ``` It shows that (at least) two columns are returned; the status name and the status id. There is also (at least) one row returned, which contains the actual data. Which columns are included depends on the configuration made in the \u201cQuery Result Columns\u201d of the Dialog Setup admin page (for QueryObjects service) or the definition of the Named Query (for NamedQuery service). See the Admin Guide for configuration details. For a full list of property names, look in the server\/bizclasses\/BizProperty.class.php file. ### Dialog services Whenever a client application raises a workflow dialog, it requests the dialog definition (through GetDialog service). The actual object properties are included as well (in GetDialog -&gt; MetaData) to be displayed in the dialog. The properties are flattened to the very same structure elements (MetaDataValue). This is done for client application convenience. For example, when the Status property is configured to show in the dialog, and the object is currently in the \u201cFor Review\u201d status (id=257), the returned structure looks like the following fragment: ```xml <GetDialogResponse> <Dialog> ... <MetaData> ... <MetaDataValue> <Property>State<\/Property> <Values> <String>257<\/String> <\/Values> <\/MetaDataValue> ... <\/MetaData> ... <\/Dialog> <\/GetDialogResponse> ``` You might wonder why the name of the status id property is not named *StateId*, but just *State*. This is because from an admin user point of view (configuring dialogs) the status name should be shown. But, in the dialog, the end user is selecting a status from the list, which results in an id. To make references correctly within this service response, the *State* property is used to represent the status id. See *Workflow services* for a detailed service explanation. ## Object metadata As mentioned in the previous paragraph, object properties can be structured in a hierarchical tree. The advantage is that the structure is organized, humanly readable and the data types are pre-defined for all built-in properties. This is done by using the *MetaData* definition in the workflow WSDL. It consists of the following main structure parts with different purposes: - *BasicMetaData* - Identifies the object and tells how it is bound to the Brand and workflow. For new objects, there is no id, and so name, type and Brand (publication) are needed. - *TargetMetaData* - Obsoleted since Enterprise Server 6.0. Use Object -&gt; Targets instead. See *Structural change for multiple channels* for more information. - *RightsMetaData* - Copyright information. - *SourceMetaData* - Credit information. - *ContentMetaData* - Properties closely related to the native content file. Which properties are filled differs per object type or file format. These properties are versioned. - *WorkflowMetaData* - Tells how the object is currently doing in the workflow. Who created it, who is working on it, what the progress status is, what deadlines should be met, etc. - *ExtraMetaData* - Used to carry custom properties along with the object. Since these properties are configurable, there is no type checking done through the WSDL. ## Object renditions Per individual object, Enterprise can store multiple files, called renditions. Typically objects have a native rendition and possibly preview, thumbnail and output renditions. The WSDL identifies the following renditions: - none - no rendition, used for example to get an object's properties without any of its files. - thumb - optimized for thumbnail overviews, typically JPEG of approximately 100 pixels wide. - preview - optimized for preview purposes, typically JPEG of approximately 600 pixels wide. - placement - abstract rendition, requested by InDesign when an image is placed. The Enterprise Server returns the rendition with the highest quality, preferably native. - native - primary rendition used for editing, for example a PSD file for an image. - output - export rendition, typically PDF or EPS for the pages of a layout object. - trailer - preview rendition for audio\/video. ## Object relations Objects can be related to each other in several ways. For example, an article can be placed onto a layout. In this case we speak of a \u2018Placed\u2019 relation type of which the layout is the parent and the article is the child. Another example is an image that is put into a Dossier. In this case, we speak of a \u2018Contained\u2019 relation type with Dossier as parent and image as child. Most relations are parent-child relations which implies that they can be represented hierarchically in the search results. The complete list of supported relation types can be found in the *RelationType* element of the workflow WSDL file. The \u2018Related\u2019 type is used for Dossiers that are related to each other. Unlike the hierarchical relations, this is a brother-sister relation which are therefore not shown in the search results. Client applications typically inform the server explicitly which relations to make (or remove). The following workflow services can be used to manage object relations: - CreateObjectRelations - UpdateObjectRelations - DeletetObjectRelations - GetObjectRelations \\[Since 7.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 7.0 users can create an object (let\u2019s say a new article), whereby he\/she is offered to select the \u201cCreate Dossier\u201d item of the Dossier property in the workflow dialog. Therefore, the object creation service (CreateObjects) supports implicit Dossier creation. This is simply done by sending a fictitious relation to the Dossier through this service. This triggers the server to create a new Dossier before creating the article. With both objects available, the server then creates a \u2018Contained\u2019 relation between them. Since the parent Dossier object is not created at the time when the service is called, there is no id and so -1 should be specified. The fragment below shows how this is done. ```xml <CreateObjects> <Objects> <Object> ... <Relations> <Relation> <Parent>-1<\/Parent> <Child xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <Type>Contained<\/Type> ... ```",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Layouts and Placements sortid: 020 permalink: 1057-layouts-and-placements --- ## Layouts and pages Enterprise stores InDesign files (layouts). With a layout, layout template, Layout Module or Layout Module template, pages are stored. These layout flavors are objects, but note that the pages themselves are not treated as objects. Whenever the term *layout* is used in the paragraph, it refers to any of the layout flavors. ## Page renditions Pages have renditions, just like objects have. And so, a thumb, preview and output rendition file can be stored per page. The output rendition is typically PDF or EPS. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image18.png %}) Note: Page rendition files are not versioned; only the last version of each rendition is tracked. When restoring an old version of a layout without InDesign intervention, the page renditions remain untouched. As a result, the version that is \u2018too new\u2019 is still shown in the Publication Overview. ### Page numbers Per page, the following is tracked: order, number and sequence. The *order* stands for the logical internal numeric position, as used by InDesign internally. Per page section, you can restart this numbering. Although you choose a numbering system (alphanumeric, roman, arabic, etc), the order is always numeric. The page *number* is the human readable representation. This reflects the page numbering system and optionally can be prefixed with the page section prefix. The number is typically used to print on the page. The page *sequence* represents the page position within the layout. This is used to uniquely identify pages since the page order does not tell, as shown in the following figure. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image19.png %}) It shows a layout with 7 pages divided into 3 page sections. Each section uses a different numbering system, respectively roman, arabic and alphanumeric. The second section has continued numbering and defines prefixes. The third section has restarted numbering. ### Splitting up pages The example above could work for small documents such as brochures. For large documents, such as magazines and books, splitting up pages into multiple layouts is recommended. Let\u2019s split-up the pages in three layout objects, exactly the way it is split-up by page sections. You will end up with 3 layouts, each having one page section, as shown in the following figure. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image20.png %}) Notice that the page *sequence* is now \u2018restarted\u2019 per layout object. With pages split-up into layouts, they are no longer strictly bound to each other. This enables the server to put them in the Publication Overview with more intelligence. When creating a new layout (for example containing pages p6 and p7) this automatically gets inserted into the overview, without the need to open and edit \u201clayout 2\u201d. ## Placements and Elements With InDesign, articles and images are placed on layouts by using frames. Frames can either be textual or graphical. From a multiple frame selection, an article can be created. Images are created from a single frame. Each frame has geometrical information and is stored into Enterprise as a *Placement* (whenever an object is made from it). Consider a placed article shown on the left in the figure below. It consist of five frames; one *head* frame, one *intro* frame and three *body* frames. The three *body* frames are linked for continuous reading. The figure in the middle shows how InDesign frames become Enterprise placements. Multiple frames that are linked are seen as just one story, just like single frames. A story is called *Element* in Enterprise (or Component for the end user). In the example, the three *body* frames become one *Element*. So the article consists of three elements\/components; *head*, *intro* and *body*, as shown on the right. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image21.png %}) ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image22.png %}) ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image23.png %}) Assume that the article is placed on the layout. The create and save requests (CreateObjects and SaveObjects) will carry out the elements and placements to the server. For **layout** create\/save operations in Objects -&gt; Object -&gt; Placements element, the structure is shown in the fragment below. The *ElementID* for the body placements is the same. This way, the placements are bundled per element. The *FrameOrder* tells the reading sequence of the placements. ```xml ... <Placements> <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>head<\/Element> <ElementID>CAA9DCF6-4F67-43AE-B9E0-1E01DBA40CC4<\/ElementID> <FrameOrder>0<\/FrameOrder> ... <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>intro<\/Element> <ElementID>D65C0A5F-8E0B-4456-985A-ECC03BDAE6C4<\/ElementID> <FrameOrder>0<\/FrameOrder> ... <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>body<\/Element> <ElementID>23383EBF-4740-4481-AF76-C7410744A094<\/ElementID> <FrameOrder>0<\/FrameOrder> ... <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>body<\/Element> <ElementID>23383EBF-4740-4481-AF76-C7410744A094<\/ElementID> <FrameOrder>1<\/FrameOrder> ... <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>body<\/Element> <ElementID>23383EBF-4740-4481-AF76-C7410744A094<\/ElementID> <FrameOrder>2<\/FrameOrder> ... <\/Placements> ... ``` For **article** create\/save operations in Objects -&gt; Object -&gt; Placements element, the structure is shown in the fragment below. It lists the three elements. ```xml ... <Elements> <Element> <ID>CAA9DCF6-4F67-43AE-B9E0-1E01DBA40CC4<\/ID> <Name>head<\/Name> ... <Element> <ID>D65C0A5F-8E0B-4456-985A-ECC03BDAE6C4<\/ID> <Name>intro<\/Name> ... <Element> <ID>23383EBF-4740-4481-AF76-C7410744A094<\/ID> <Name>body<\/Name> ... <\/Elements> ... ``` \\[Since 9.4\\] When two articles would share the same Element IDs (GUIDs), placing these articles together on the same layout could lead in content loss. Therefore, if a client other than InDesign, InCopy or InDesignServer calls the CreateObjects service (with Lock=*false*) for a WCML article, Enterprise Server generates new Element IDs (GUIDs) and updates the Elements and the article WCML before saving it in the database and filestore. ### Articles and graphics Articles can consist of a mix of text frames and graphic frames. The figure below shows an article with one graphic frame and two text frames, as shown on the left. In the middle, it shows there is just one object involved, which is the article. On the right, it shows that there are three elements. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image24.png %}) ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image25.png %}) ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image26.png %}) The very same example could be made differently. The figure below shows a graphics frame that holds a placed image object. (Note the little chain icon on the left of the butterfly, which is shown instead of the little pencil icon on top.) The two text frames belong to the article object, as shown in the middle. Also here, there are three elements involved, as shown on the right. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image27.png %}) ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image28.png %}) ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image26.png %}) ### Placements and Editions Placed objects (such as articles and images) can be assigned an Edition on the layout. InDesign allows users to set Editions per story element (changing one frame affects all frames that belong to the same element). Nevertheless, Editions are tracked by Enterprise at a more granular level, which is per placement. An example. Imagine you have written a manual about your InDesign CS3 plug-in. Then CS4 comes out, but you are still doing heavy maintenance to the document and update your readers on a regular basis. Actually, the CS4 update doesn\u2019t have much impact to your document. It affects just some articles and the InDesign logo that is used in several places. Obviously, you would like to share as much as possible between the two manuals and publish both simultaneously. This is where editioning could help. By simply placing the CS3 and CS4 logo in the same InDesign layout, and tagging CS3 Edition for one and CS4 Edition for the other. The figure on the right shows how the result could look like in InDesign. CS3 | CS4 ---|--- ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image29.png %}) | ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image30.png %}) When saving the layout, the request from InDesign (SaveObjects) looks like the fragment shown below. because there are three objects related, there are three *Related* elements. They are all on the same page and share the same parent. For the images, a specific Edition is specified. The article is published for both Editions, and so nil is given, which means all Editions. Note that adding CS5 and CS6 Editions later (in the Maintenance pages), this article will still get published for those future Editions. But there won\u2019t be any logos available yet, which must be created and placed on the layout at that time, just as it was done in this example for CS4. ```xml ... <Relations> <Relation> <!-- CS3 logo --> <Parent>1710<\/Parent> <Child>1711<\/Child> <Type>Placed<\/Type> <Placements> <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>graphic<\/Element> ... <Edition> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>CS3<\/Name> <\/Edition> ... <Relation> <!-- CS4 logo --> <Parent>1710<\/Parent> <Child>1712<\/Child> <Type>Placed<\/Type> <Placements> <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>graphic<\/Element> ... <Edition> <Id>2<\/Id> <Name>CS4<\/Name> <\/Edition> ... <Relation> <!-- article --> <Parent>1710<\/Parent> <Child>1713<\/Child> <Type>Placed<\/Type> <Placements> <Placement> <Page>1<\/Page> <Element>body<\/Element> ... <Edition xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> ... ``` ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Object Targets sortid: 030 permalink: 1058-object-targets --- Objects can be targeted for an Issue. This means it is intended to get published for that Issue. During creation, or at the end of the selection & gathering phase, objects typically get targeted. During production, users could add (or remove) targets to send them through additional publication channels. After production, admin users might postpone some objects (that could not get published) to the next Issue by changing targets. With Enterprise Server 5.x (or earlier), objects were always targeted for just one Issue though. Objects can have zero, one or many targets. Zero targets are especially needed to support selection & gathering. Many targets are needed to support multiple channeling. The left the figure below shows some example objects targeted for several Issues. Targets are represented by dashed arrows. Each Issue belongs to a certain channel, such as \u201cEuro Site\u201d which belongs to the \u201cWeb\u201d channel. The figure on the right shows how the abstract Enterprise entities are related to each other. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image31.png %}) ### Target Editions For print channels, admin users can setup Editions per channel. (This is done by means of the Maintenance pages, see the Admin Guide for details.) When an object is targeted for an Issue that belongs to a print channel, end users can select any of the configured Editions in the workflow dialogs. Selected Editions are tracked by Enterprise per target. The figure to the right illustrates how Editions relate to targets. (It zooms into a fragment of the target example shown above.) As shown, the user has selected three Editions for the target. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image32.png %}) When the object should be targeted for all Editions, client applications should pass xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d attribute for the *Editions* element. This is an exceptional meaning of the nil attribute; for other entities (other than Editions) nil means that the data is not provided, which implies existing data needs to remain untouched in the database. ### Object targets During create and save operations (CreateObjects and SaveObjects workflow services) the object targets can be set. These operations only work for objects that are locked by the current user. **Important**: When an object is locked for editing by the current user, its targets can be set by other users in the meantime. Therefore, the targets sent through the create and save operations are assumed to be complete. > Since Enterprise Server 6.0, the `TargetMetaData` element is obsolete. (For more details, see *Structural change for multiple channels*.) Instead, the `Targets` element should be used and the `TargetMetaData` element should be nullified (by setting the `xsi:nil=\"true\"` attribute). Example of `Target` usage: ```xml <Object> <MetaData> ... <TargetMetaData xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> ... <Targets> <Target> <Issue> <Id>421<\/Id> <Name>USA Magazine<\/Name> <\/Issue> <Editions> <Edition> <Id>801<\/Id> <Name>West USA<\/Name> <\/Edition> <Edition> <Id>802<\/Id> <Name>Central USA<\/Name> <\/Edition> ... ``` When objects are locked by someone else, client applications can still change the object targets. This can be done by calling the following workflow services: - CreateObjectTargets - UpdateObjectTargets - DeleteObjectTargets **Important:** Similar to the create\/save operations, the *UpdateObjectTargets* service assumes that the passed object targets are complete. ### Related targets Objects can inherit targets from other objects. This typically happens when objects are related to each other. Let\u2019s take the \u201cweather forecast USA\u201d example and assume it consist of two articles and a Dossier. One article is in HTML format, and the other in InCopy format. The Dossier is given two object targets: \u201cUSA Site\u201d and \u201cUSA Magazine\u201d. In Content Station the Dossier looks as follows: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image33.png %}) As we can see, the user has targeted each article to a different issue. Now, the Dossier has object targets, but the articles each have a related target. The figure below shows how that is tracked in Enterprise\u2019s data model. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image34.png %}) When the user tags the related targets for the articles, Content Station calls the *UpdateObjectRelation* service. For the Dossier-article relation, it passes the targets as shown in the following fragment: ```xml <UpdateObjectRelations> ... <Relations> <Relation> <Parent>1461<\/Parent> <Child>1464<\/Child> <Type>Contained<\/Type> ... <Targets> <Target> <Issue> <Id>89<\/Id> <Name>USA Magazine<\/Name> <\/Issue> <Editions xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <\/Target> ... ``` Let\u2019s involve a layout in this example. The layout is just targeted to the print issue \u201cUSA magazine\u201d. When the article is placed on the layout, an object relation is created between both. And again, upon the relation, a new relation target build. The following figure shows how this is tracked in the Enterprise model: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image35.png %}) ## Structural change for multiple channels Since Enterprise Server 6.0, various structural changes have been implemented which are mainly about the need to support multiple publication channels. This had quite some impact on the workflow WSDL as described below. This paragraph is written for those who are migrating from Enterprise Server 3.x \/ 4.x \/ 5.x (to 6.0 or higher). New insights told that objects are no longer targeted to a Brand (formerly called Publication). The object is owned by the Brand, and therefore the *Publication* element needed to move from *TargetMetaData* to *BasicMetaData*. At Brand level, Issues and Editions could be configured. There was a need to introduce another concept, namely Publication Channels. Publication Channels are configured as part of the Brand, and Issues and Editions are configured as part of the Publication Channel. Objects could be assigned to just one Issue at the same time. Also here, another concept was introduced, called a target. A target is one Issue with optionally a set of Editions. An object can be \u2018targeted\u2019 to many Issues, which is established by having multiple targets. The *TargetMetaData* element could hold one \u2018target\u2019 only (which was one Issue with many Editions). To support many, a new element named *Targets* was introduced directly under the *Object* element. This move was also done because targets can change while objects are locked (while other properties can\u2019t). To visualize this, the targets do no longer belong under the *MetaData* element. The term 'section' is too print oriented and does not cover its intended use. Also, for other channels than print, the term 'section' is not appropriate. Therefore it was changed to 'category', not only for the GUI, but for the WSDL as well. For channels other than print, the term section did not have much meaning. It is therefore changed to Category, not only for the GUI, but for the WSDL as well. Just like the *Publication* element, the *Section* is nothing like a target anymore. Therefore it is moved to *BasicMetaData* element too, and renamed to *Category*. Although the WSDL structure has been changed, Enterprise Server 6.x and 7.x still support requests that are structured the old way for backwards compatibility reasons. Nevertheless, this will no longer be done for future versions. Server Plug-in developers don\u2019t have to deal with this since the core server does restructure on-the-fly before calling the plug-ins for incoming requests, and after outgoing responses. This includes all changes mentioned above. So Server Plug-ins should deal with the new structure only, while there could be still old clients talking. ```xml <Object> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> ... <Publication> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>WW News<\/Name> <\/Publication> <Category> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>News<\/Name> <\/Category> ... <\/BasicMetaData> <TargetMetaData xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> ... <Targets> <Target> <Issue> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>2nd issue<\/Name> <\/Issue> <Editions> <Edition> <Id>1<\/Id> <Name>North<\/Name> <\/Edition> <Edition> <Id>2<\/Id> <Name>South<\/Name> <\/Edition> <\/Editions> ... ```",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Planning sortid: 010 permalink: 1040-planning --- Planning is an optional feature which is taken care of by a third-party plan system integrated in Enterprise. Which plan system to integrate is the customer\u2019s choice. Examples are Journal Designer (DataPlan) and Timone (Tell). Planning integrations are typically established through the planning interface, but in some cases with extra help of the workflow interface. Planning integrations allow planners to synchronize their issue plans to the production system. Customers can work in two different way, both of which are supported: * **Throw the plan over the fence** - Some customers like to create a full plan, synchronize it, continue in production, and no longer care about the plan. At this point, the planning system could shut down and progress is monitored in production (using the Publication Overview). This is the most simple form, wherein production takes over the lead. * **Continuous synchronization** - Some customers have a dedicated planner who takes the lead from creation till the planned issue gets finally printed. Plans are continuously synchronized with production while many editors and layout designers are producing pages. The idea is that the planner is the boss and so plans should be respected in production. For example, layout designers in production are bound to the planned pages and their numbering, but they have full control over the placed objects. Placed adverts are the only exception in this and are created by the planner. Advert positions on pages are important since ads have different prices depending on their positions. Layout designers have to respect that, but still have some freedom to make them fit onto the page nicely. ## Page planning Pages are used within a print-oriented workflow. Pages can be planned, produced and printed. In this context, Enterprise does the production, and third-party systems do the planning and printing. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image36.png %}) While the planner is creating pages in the plan system, planned pages also get created within the Enterprise database through the planning interface. This is done by creating layout objects from layout templates, which reside in the Enterprise database. The template pages are replicated for the layout for as many pages that are planned (by the planner). The following figure shows a planner with four pages planned \\[1\\]. The third-party planning tool picks up those pages and synchronizes \\[2\\] the four pages into the Enterprise system through the planning interface. The Enterprise Server retrieves \\[3\\] the requested layout template and creates a new layout \\[4\\] from it. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image37.png %}) At this point, a layout is created in Enterprise database with four planned pages. The InstanceType (as defined at workflow WSDL) is set to \u2018Planning\u2019 for these pages. Also, a message is sent to the layout and a flag is set. The flag indicates that the attention of the layout designer is needed; the message informs the layout designer about the creations (or changes) made to the planned layout. Once pages are planned, the production can pick them up. The layout designer finds the flagged layouts that were planned at his\/her query results. (To see the flags, special query columns must be configured; for more information, see the Admin Guide.) At this point, the binary layout file itself is a rough copy (made by the server) of the layout template. Once the layout designer opens it, this file is sent from the server to the InDesign client, along with the planned(!) pages. Once opened in InDesign, the Smart Catalog plug-ins are able to create concrete pages (for production) based on the arrived planned pages and update the binary file. Before doing so, a dialog is raised to ask the layout designer whether or not to do this automatically. The layout designer can cancel this and do it manually. When the message is confirmed though, it is done automatically by the plug-ins. This includes the following operations: Pages are added or removed, because the template could have less or more pages than the layout requires. New pages are based on the master page, as indicated by the planner. Pages are renumbered, to reflect the Issue planning. Template pages typically start with page 1, but layout pages could start with any number, depending on their position in the planning. Adverts are placed on pages. For more details, see *advert planning*. Let\u2019s recap the step wherein planned pages are taken into production (see the figure below). First, the layout designer opens a layout \\[1\\] and the plug-ins request it to get \\[2\\] it from the database. The planned pages (orange) are synchronized \\[3\\] into production by the plug-ins. The produced pages (red) are saved \\[4\\] on the layout designer\u2019s command and stored \\[5\\] in the database. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image38.png %}) Now there are two sets of pages: planned and produced. The produced pages have the InstanceType (as defined at workflow WSDL) set to \u2018Production\u2019. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Object Editing sortid: 110 permalink: 1047-object-editing --- ## Common sequences Client applications implement all kinds of features by requesting services in the server. Many services stand on their own, but there are some logical sequences that are commonly used. This paragraph takes you by the hand running through the most important sequences while explaining the system at high level. ### Startup and login The figure below shows an end user (on the lleft) working with a client application (center) which talks through SOAP with the server (right). When the user starts \\[1\\] the client application, it does some initialization and requests \\[2\\] the server to return \\[3\\] a list of the configured\\* application servers. \\* Note: These servers are configured by admin users on the client machines (using the SCEnt:Servers setting in the WWSettings.xml file) or at a centralized server machine (using APPLICATION\\_SERVERS setting in the configserver.php file). (For configuration details, see theAdmin Guide.) The example assumes that the application servers are configured server side. If not, steps \\[2\\] and \\[3\\] are skipped. This list is shown \\[4\\] in the login dialog. The user enters his \/ her name and password, picks one of the listed application servers and submits \\[5\\] the dialog. The client requests the picked server to login \\[6\\] and passes the name and password entered by the user. The server checks the user account and returns \\[7\\] a newly created ticket to start a session. This ticket is used by the client for all next following requests. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image39.png %}) Implicit to the login operation, clients fire a search request \\[8\\]. This can be the inbox (such as Content Station does) or the last-used query (such as InDesign does). The server runs the query in the database and returns \\[9\\] a list of objects. The client lists \\[10\\] the objects as rows in a table view. ### Editing a document Once the client is started and the user is logged in, the user can start working. Let\u2019s say that the user want to edit an article, layout or image. The figure below shows how that is done. The user picks \\[1\\] one of the listed objects from the query results. The client takes the object id of the selected row and requests \\[2\\] to lock that object id and retrieve the native file of the object. When not already locked, the server locks the object, retrieves the native file from the file store and sends \\[3\\] it back (as DIME attachment). The client saves the file locally and opens it \\[4\\] in its own application (such as InDesign) or starts another application (such as Photoshop). Now the user starts editing the file and does a check-in \\[5\\] once completed. The client requests \\[6\\] for the dialog definition. The server queries the definition (as defined on the admin pages) from the database and returns it \\[7\\]. The client builds the dialog based on the definition and shows \\[8\\] it to the user. The user adjusts some properties in the workflow dialog \\[9\\] such as the status. The client uploads \\[10\\] the file (as a DIME attachment) back to the server, which creates a new version and stores it in the file store. The updated object properties are returned \\[11\\] when successful. When the client did not unlock the object while saving \\[10\\], it unlocks afterwards \\[13\\] for which the server does return \\[14\\] no info. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image40.png %}) ## Object locking Object files can be opened for editing by any user (with \u201cOpen for Edit\u201d access rights). Doing so, objects are locked to prevent two users accidentally working on the same content at the same time. Once an object is locked, other users can read it, but cannot update the object files nor the object properties. Other aspects to objects are not locked though, such as targets, messages, and relations. Those could be changed by other users while the object is locked. ### Creating and opening When creating new objects, the lock can be preserved to let the user continue editing the content. This is mostly done for a \u201cSave Version\u201d action of an article or layout for which a *CreateObjects* service is called, as shown in the fragment below. When the user does a \u201cCheck In\u201d action to a new file, the same request is fired but then the *Lock* parameter is set to *false* instead. This is mostly done for new image file uploads. ```xml <CreateObjects> <Ticket>5863c2527QG5KBoTnmSEX8yPrX6P9S1IF7Wxbnfj<\/Ticket> <Lock>true<\/Lock> <Objects> <Object> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> ... ``` For existing objects, a lock can be set through the *GetObjects* service by setting the *Lock* parameter to *true* as shown in fragment below. ```xml <GetObjects> <Ticket>5863c2527QG5KBoTnmSEX8yPrX6P9S1IF7Wxbnfj<\/Ticket> <IDs> <String>1720<\/String> <\/IDs> <Lock xsi:type=\"xsd:boolean\">true<\/Lock> ... <\/GetObjects> ``` ### Storing and closing When the user has changed the object properties and the object file content, a new version can be created, and the lock can be released simultaneously. For new objects, the *CreateObjects* service is called, and *SaveObjects* service for existing objects. This is mostly done for \u201cCheck In\u201d actions, as shown here: ```xml <SaveObjects> <Ticket>5863c2527QG5KBoTnmSEX8yPrX6P9S1IF7Wxbnfj<\/Ticket> <CreateVersion xsi:type=\"xsd:boolean\">true<\/CreateVersion> <ForceCheckIn xsi:type=\"xsd:boolean\">false<\/ForceCheckIn> <Unlock xsi:type=\"xsd:boolean\">false<\/Unlock> <Objects> <Object> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID>1720<\/ID> ... ``` Alternatively, when all object properties and file content is already saved before, just the lock can be released through the more cheaper *UnlockObjects* service as shown in the next fragment. ```xml <UnlockObjects> <Ticket>5863c2527QG5KBoTnmSEX8yPrX6P9S1IF7Wxbnfj<\/Ticket> <IDs> <String>1720<\/String> <\/IDs> ... <\/UnlockObjects> ``` ### Setting properties Properties can be changed for a single object by using the *SetObjectProperties* service and for multiple objects (since 9.2) by using the *MultiSetObjectProperties* service. Note that most object properties can be changed, but the contents of the object files remains untouched and so properties that are strongly content related can also not be changed either. Because the Version property is content related, it won\u2019t get increased. There are two ways of locking, each with their own advantages and disadvantages: * **Optimistic locking.** This method is used when the file was not previously locked by the client and the service is called directly. In this scenario, the file is not actually locked during the time the user updates the properties. It is assumed that the changes can be submitted without the file being locked by another user in the mean time. This method was implemented in Content Station 7. * **Pessimistic locking.** In this method, the client application first locks the object (through *GetObjects* or *CreateObjects* service) and then calls the *SetObjectProperties* service. It then needs to release the lock through the *UnlockObjects* service afterwards. This way, before the dialog is shown to the user, it could already fail (when someone else has locked it in the meantime) and an error raises. This method was implemented in Smart Connection 7. \\[Since 9.2\\] The *MultiSetObjectProperties* service is designed to simultaneously modify a few properties for many objects. For a selection of multiple objects, it is significantly faster to use this service than repeatedly calling the *SetObjectProperties* service for each object. **Important notes for Server Plug-ins**: * Instead of \u201cSet Properties\u201d, users can use the \u201cSend To\u201d or the \u201cSend To Next\u201d actions as well. Doing so, client applications fire the *SendTo* workflow request to the server. Internally, the server redirects this service to the *SetObjectProperties* service as soon as it arrives, even before any Server Plug-in connector is called. The *SendTo* service is actually a simplified version of the *SetObjectProperties* service. During redirection, the server enriches some object information such as the object targets. This is all done to simplify property interception using custom Server Plugins. In other terms, the *WflSendTo* service connector is never(!) called and *WflSetObjectProperties* is called instead. * \\[Since 9.2\\] When implementing the *WlfSetObjectProperties* connector it is mandatory to also implement the *WflMultiSetObjectProperties* connector for the plug-in, and vice versa. Failure to do so will result in validation errors on the Server Plug-ins or Health Check pages. * \\[Since 9.2\\] When implementing the *WlfSendTo* connector it is mandatory to also implement the *WflSendToNext* connector for the plug-in, and vice versa. Failure to do so will result in validation errors on the Server Plug-ins or Health Check pages. ## Automatic workflow status assignment \\[since 8.2\\] Since Enterprise Server 8.2 it is allowed to create objects without specifying a status. Enterprise Server will then automatically take the first status configured in the workflow (for the given object type and Brand). When there are no statuses defined, but the Personal Status feature is enabled, a Personal Status will be assigned to the newly created object. SOAP clients calling the CreateObjects service should set the State to nil as follows: ```xml <CreateObjects> <Objects> <Object> <MetaData> ... <WorkflowMetaData> ... <State xsi:nil=\"true\"> ... <\/WorkflowMetaData> ... <\/MetaData> <\/Object> <\/Objects> <\/CreateObjects> ``` ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Object Searching sortid: 120 permalink: 1048-object-searching --- Object searching is the heart of Enterprise; it is a fundamental and complex centralized feature of the workflow system pumping objects through its veins. To breakdown complexity and to differentiate between all kind of search features, Enterprise has introduced several functional areas, as explained in this paragraph. The *search results* are explained in a following paragraph. ## Freestyle search Enterprise supports freestyle search: users can search for objects their own way using various parameters. This feature is supported by the *QueryObjects* service. This subparagraph describes several ways of using this service. ## Full text search The user can type just a piece of text to search for, without indicating to which object property the filtering should be applied. In fact, the user is grabbing for text through any property. The figure below shows how this search looks in Content Station. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image41.png %}) When the user clicks the search button, the client application fires the *QueryObjects* request to the server. The fragment below shows how this looks. Since there is actually no specific property involved, it passes the reserved property name *Search* to trigger this feature in the server. ```xml <QueryObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>Search<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>hello world<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> ... ``` ## Browse search The most direct and simple way of searching is by selecting one of the predefined filters (also known as Search Modes). The figure below shows that the user has chosen the \u201cWW News\u201d Brand and the \u201csport\u201d Category using Content Station. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image42.png %}) After clicking the search button, Content Station fires a search query, as shown in the fragment below. The ids of the Brand (formerly publication) and Category are passed. ```xml <QueryObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>PublicationId<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>1<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <QueryParam> <Property>CategpryId<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>3<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> ... ``` ## User Query In the \u201cDialog Setup\u201d Maintenance page, system admin users can define what parameters are allowed for filtering within User Queries (the Search Modes \u201cSearch\u201d or \u201cCustom Search\u201d in the client GUI). (See the Admin Guide for configuration details.) In the example below, the *In Use By* property is configured for the query parameters. Internally this property is named *LockedBy*. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image43.png %}) A user logged in to a client application can add the pre-configured query parameters to any custom search query. The figure below shows a fraction of the \u201cSearch Criteria\u201d dialog in InDesign. In this example, the user has just added the *LockedBy* property to his\/her query: ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image44.png %}) InDesign then fires the query request as show in the fragment below. Now it uses the unequal operation (!=) and leaves the value empty, just like the user did. The server then returns all objects that are currently in use. See the last subparagraph for an example of how the results usually look. ```xml <QueryObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>LockedBy<\/Property> <Operation>!=<\/Operation> <Value\/> <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> .. ``` The full set of operators can be found in the workflow WSDL. The fragment below shows the definition (made for Enterprise Server 7.0) in two-fold. On the left, the WSDL is opened in a plain-text editor and on the right it is opened in an XML editor (or Web browser). The plain-text version shows that some operators use \u201c&lt;\u201d. This is the XML escaped representation of \u201c&lt;\u201d which means \u201cless than\u201d. In an XML editor (or Web browser) it shows the escaped version. The SOAP requests contain the escaped \u201c&lt;\u201d character because \u201c&lt;\u201d is a reserved symbol in XML. Nevertheless, this is hidden from client applications (using SOAP\/XML tools) and from Server Plug-ins; they simply use the unescaped \u201c&lt;\u201d character. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image45.png %}) ```xml <simpleType name=\"OperationType\"> <restriction base=\"string\"> <enumeration value=\"&lt;\"\/> <enumeration value=\">\"\/> <enumeration value=\"&lt;=\"\/> <enumeration value=\">=\"\/> <!-- 4.2 - Greater Than or Equal --> <enumeration value=\"=\"\/> <enumeration value=\"!=\"\/> <enumeration value=\"contains\"\/> <enumeration value=\"starts\"\/> <enumeration value=\"ends\"\/> <enumeration value=\"within\"\/> <!-- 5.0 Time interval --> <\/restriction> <\/simpleType> ``` ## Saving a User Query Enterprise client applications allow users to save their queries. The user can fill in a name as shown in the figure to the right. At this stage, the query is saved in the memory of the client application. When the user logs out, the queries are stored in the server through the *LogOff* request, as shown in the fragment below. The WSDL tells that the *Value* element must be a string. Adding XML elements as a string would make the SOAP request invalid. Therefore the string is escaped. Escaped characters are hard to read for humans, so in the example below they are left out and green colored italic formatting is used instead. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image46.png %}) ```xml <LogOff> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <SaveSettings xsi:type=\"xsd:boolean\">true<\/SaveSettings> <Settings> <Setting> <Setting>UserQuery3_My Search<\/Setting> <Value> <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\" ?> <UserQuery> <QueryParam> <Type>string<\/Type> <Property>LockedBy<\/Property> <Operation>!=<\/Operation> <Value><\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <\/UserQuery> <\/Value> <\/Setting> <\/Setting> ... ``` The next time a user logs in again, the saved query is passed back (using the same structure) through the login response in the LogOnResponse -&gt; Settings element. The query is then made available to the user to run again (or to make justifications). ## Search by date In a QueryObjects request, parameters can be added by specifying a Property, Operator and a Value. For any of the date object properties such as Created, Modified and Deleted, the operators \u2018starts\u2019 and \u2018within\u2019 can be used. A specification of the Value format can be found on w3.org: *XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition*. This format is partially implemented by Enterprise Server as explained in the following paragraphs. **The \u2018starts\u2019 operator** Enterprise validates the following syntax for the Value attribute: `[-]? [P] [017] [D]` With the following meaning: * `[-]?` The - (minus) is optional. If it is present, it requests to search backward in time, else forward in time. Note that for the currently supported date properties, looking forward is rather exceptional and therefore not described here. * `[P]` The P is mandatory and denotes a duration field. * `[017]` The number of days (mandatory), which can be 0, 1 or 7. The handling of the number of days is as follows: * `0` Everything where the date matches today (from 00:00:00 up to 23:59:59). * `1` Everything where the date matches yesterday (from 00:00:00 till 23:59:59, so excluding today). This requires the leading minus. * `7` Looks at the last full week, starting from the first day of last week up to the last day of last week (so excluding this week). This requires the leading minus. * `[D]` The D is mandatory and indicates that the duration is in Days. Valid examples: * `-P7D` (= last full week, excluding this week) * `P0D` (= today) Example request for objects that were modified yesterday: ```xml <QueryObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>Modified<\/Property> <Operation>starts<\/Operation> <Value>-P1D<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> .. ``` **The \u2018within\u2019 operator** Enterprise validates the following syntax for the Value attribute: `[-]? [P] [T]? [0-9]+ [DMH]` With the following meaning: * `[-]`? The - (minus) is optional. If it is present it requests to look an x number of duration units before now. If it is absent it requests to look for a number of duration units from now. * `[P]` The P is mandatory and denotes a duration field. * `[T]?` The T is optional. If specified, the duration is a Time, else a Date. * `[0-9]+` The number of duration units (mandatory) represented by one or more digits. * `[DMH]` The duration unit, which must be one of these characters: D, M or H. * The meaning depends if T is specified: * When T is not specified: D = days, M = months. (H is not valid.) * When T is specified: H = hours, M = minutes. (D is not valid.) Note: Unlike the \u2018starts\u2019 operation, there is no special handling for the number: if you request 7 days in the past it will look from 7 days in the past, and not the full week before. Valid examples: * `-PT30M` (= last 30 minutes) * `-P1M` (= last month) Example request for objects that were created within the last half year: ```xml <QueryObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>Created<\/Property> <Operation>within<\/Operation> <Value>-P6M<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> .. ``` ## Predefined search Enterprise supports predefined searches;: users can pick a predefined query (also called Named Query or Custom Search) and optionally use one of its parameters (if any). This feature is supported by the *NamedQuery* service. This paragraph describes several ways of using this service. **Inbox** Maybe the most frequently used query is the *Inbox* query. It shows the objects that are assigned to the user or one of the groups the user is in. From the *Inbox*, the user opens files that must be worked on. Up to Enterprise Server 6.x, the *Inbox* query was shipped as a true Named Query. This implies that any system admin user can adjust it in the \u201cNamed Queries\u201d Maintenance page. \\[Since 7.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 7.0, the *Inbox* is built-in to the server. Nevertheless, it still acts as a true Named Query, as if it still exists. It is hidden from the \u201cNamed Queries\u201d Maintenance page though, so changes cannot be made anymore. When a user selects and runs the *Inbox* query, client applications fire the *NamedQuery* request as shown in the fragment below. Content Station does this also automatically right after the user has logged in. ```xml <NamedQuery> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Query>Inbox<\/Query> <Params xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> ... ``` **Named Query** The \u201cNamed Queries\u201d Maintenance page allows admin users to configure any Named Query (see the Admin Guide for details.) Let\u2019s say he\/she has made a query called \u201cName Search\u201d and specified some parameters in the \u201cInterface\u201d field as shown in the fragment below. There are two parameters; *ObjectName* and *ObjectType*. The type has a default value *Layout* of a list with three options: *Article*, *Image* and *Layout*. ``` ObjectName,string ObjectType,list,Layout,Article\/Image\/Layout ``` When the user logs in to Enterprise, the configured Named Queries are returned by the server through the *LogOnResponse*. The fragment below shows how that is done for our \u201cName Search\u201d example query. Per query, it specifies which parameters can be used. For the example query you can find the two configured parameters. ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <NamedQueries> <NamedQuery> <Name>Name Search<\/Name> <Params> <PropertyInfo> <Name>ObjectName<\/Name> ... <\/PropertyInfo> <PropertyInfo> <Name>ObjectType<\/Name> ... <\/PropertyInfo> <\/Params> <\/NamedQuery> ... ``` Zooming into the details of ObjectType, the default value and its option are included: ```xml <PropertyInfo> <Name>ObjectType<\/Name> <DefaultValue>Layout<\/DefaultValue> <ValueList> <String>Article<\/String> <String>Image<\/String> <String>Layout<\/String> <\/ValueList> ... <\/PropertyInfo> ``` After login, the client applications list the queries in their search panes, allowing users to pick one. In the figure below, the user logged in to InDesign and has picked our *Name Search* query and filled in a search string \u201chello world\u201d for the *ObjectName* parameter. The *Layout* option of the *ObjectType* parameter is preselected (and remained untouched by user). ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image47.png %}) By clicking the Search button, InDesign fires the *NamedQuery* request as shown in the fragment below. Both parameters as filled in by the end user are sent along the request. ```xml <NamedQuery> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Query>Name Search<\/Query> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>ObjectName<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>hello world<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <QueryParam> <Property>ObjectType<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>Layout<\/Value> <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> ... ``` ## Search results Regardless of the search technique used, the granular structure of the search results is always the same. This simplifies client applications and Server Plug-ins parsing results. Although there are two different responses specified in the workflow WSDL (*QueryObjectsResponse* and *NamedQueryResponse*), both have the same structure. A search result is basically a table of columns and rows. Which columns are returned depends on the configurations made in the Maintenance pages: * For the *QueryObjects* service, the returned columns are configured on the \u201cDialog Setup\u201d page through \u201cQuery Result Columns\u201d actions. (See the Admin Guide for configuration details.) * For the *NamedQuery* service, the returned columns are determined by the SQL query as configured on the \u201cNamed Queries\u201d page. (See the Admin Guide for configuration details.) * Every found object in the search results is represented by a *Row* element, and its properties by *String* elements. An important assumption is that the n<sup>th<\/sup> *String* element corresponds with the n<sup>th<\/sup> *Property* element under *Columns*. The fragment below shows a search result listing two objects and three columns. The second column represents the object type. So the second *String* value of each row (object) contains the object type. The different colors show the mapping of rows to columns. ```xml <QueryObjectsResponse> <Columns> <Property> <Name>ID<\/Name> <DisplayName>ID<\/DisplayName> <Type>string<\/Type> <\/Property> <Property> <Name>Type<\/Name> <DisplayName>Type<\/DisplayName> <Type>string<\/Type> <\/Property> <Property> <Name>Name<\/Name> <DisplayName>Name<\/DisplayName> <Type>string<\/Type> <\/Property> ... <\/Columns> <Rows> <Row> <String>1708<\/String> <String>Article<\/String> <String>my article<\/String> ... <\/Row> <Row> <String>1721<\/String> <String>Layout<\/String> <String>my pages<\/String> ... <\/Row> ... <\/Rows> ... ``` Note that the *ID*, *Type* and *Name* properties are always returned, regardless of the configuration made. This is considered to be the bare minimum to provide client applications with. In other terms, clients may assume these properties are always present. Regardless of the property, client applications and Server Plug-ins should never hard-code column positions. For example, the *Type* column is in the second position, but it can be located at any other position. The principle shown in the following fragment may be used in your Server Plug-in (*WflQueryObjects* connector) to determine the column positions of those properties that you are looking for. When you are developing a client application, you could use this fragment as pseudo code. This custom example is only interested in *Type* and *Name* object properties. With those two column indexes available, it runs through the rows (objects) and checks the object type. For articles only, it adds \u201c(article)\u201d to the object name, to meet the customer\u2019s requirements. This customization affects the search results of all clients. Obviously you can take out any other columns and perform any other custom operation to the rows. ```php final public function runAfter( WflQueryObjectsRequest $req, WflQueryObjectsResponse &$resp ) { \/\/ Determine column indexes to work with $indexes = array( 'Type' => -1, 'Name' => -1 ); foreach( array_keys($indexes) as $colName ) { foreach( $resp->Columns as $index => $column ) { if( $column->Name == $colName ) { $indexes[$colName] = $index; break; \/\/ found } } } \/\/ Run through rows to be returned and mark articles foreach( $resp->Rows as &$row ) { \/\/ for all rows to return soap client $type = $indexes['Type'] > -1 ? $row[ $indexes['Type']] : ''; if( $type == 'Article' ) { if( $indexes['Name'] > -1 ) { $row[$indexes['Name']] .= ' (article)'; } } } } ``` Custom properties are set up on the \u201cMetadata\u201d Maintenance page. (See the Admin Guide for configuration details). These properties are internally prefixed with a \u201cC\\_\u201d. For example, a custom property named \u201cHELLO\u201d is internally called \u201cC\\_HELLO\u201d. ",

        "title": "Object Variants [since 10.4]",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Object Variants [since 10.4] sortid: 125 permalink: 1060-object-variants --- This chapter explains the Object Variants feature that was introduced since Enterprise Server 10.4. ## A master object and its variants When copying a workflow object, in most cases the intention is to start a variant of that object. In other words, a copy is mostly made to create another variation of content. The object being copied is called the master object and the copy itself is called the object variant. Once the copy is made, users and client application may want to find out which object variants exist for a given object and who is the master object. ## The \"ID of original\" object property For the Object Variants feature an object property named \"ID of original\" is introduced that refers to the id of the master object. Internally this property is named `MasterId`. When set to zero ('0') the object itself is not a variant. It could be either a master object (of which variants are made) or a normal workflow object (that has no variants). When set to a positive numeric value, the object itself is a variant and the number refers to the id of the master object it is copied from. ## Deleting a master object When a master object gets removed, the `MasterId` property set for its object variants will purposely *not* be cleared by the system. In other words, it is not guaranteed that the `MasterId` refers to an existing object. That makes this concept very different from Object Relations, since those always refer to existing objects and are automatically removed when their parent- or child object gets removed. For this reason Object Variants are not based on Object Relations. ## Create a variant of a variant After making a copy of a variant, the master remains the master, the variant remains the variant and the copy of the variant is just another variant. The master of the first copy becomes the same as the master of the second copy. In other words, both variants refer to the same master. In short, it can be stated that: * A variant created from another variant share one and the same master. * A variant used to create another variant does *not* become a master. * The master is the root\/source object of its variants and their variants (variants of variants). ## Create a variant through a Copy To operation When a client application calls the `CopyObject` web service, Enterprise Server takes care of setting the `MasterId` property. This property is set for all copied workflow objects except for Template-, Dossier-, Task-, Hyperlink- and Library objects. The client application calls the service without need to change anything in the request data: ```xml <CopyObject> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <SourceID>123<\/SourceID> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <DocumentID xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <Name>Copy of layout 123<\/Name> <Type xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> ... <MasterId xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <\/BasicMetaData> ... <\/CopyObject> ``` Enterprise Server uses the `SourceID` to resolve the `MasterId`: * When layout with `ID` 123 has no `MasterId`, the `MasterId` of the copied layout is set to 123. * When layout with `ID` 123 has a `MasterId` set to 120, the `MasterId` of the copied layout is set to 120. In the example the following response may be returned: ```xml <CopyObjectResponse> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID>124<\/ID> <DocumentID>...<\/DocumentID> <Name>Copy of layout 123<\/Name> <Type>Layout<\/Type> ... <MasterId>123<\/MasterId> <\/BasicMetaData> ... <\/CopyObjectResponse> ``` ## Create a variant through a Save As operation When a client application allows the user to Save As the currently opened document, it calls the `CreateObjects` web service. The client should take the `MasterId` from the opened document (taken from `GetObjects`) and send it along with the `CreateObjects` request. If the `MasterId` is zero ('0') the client should take the `ID` from the opened document instead. Basically the Save As operation is a kind of Copy To operation but now implemented by the client; There is no way for the server to find out whether the new object is copied from another object or created from scratch. Therefore it is the client's responsibility to implement the feature for this scenario by providing the correct value for the new `MasterId` property in the `CreateObjects` request: ```xml <CreateObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Lock>true<\/Lock> <Objects> <Object> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <DocumentID>...<\/DocumentID> <Name>SaveAs of layout 123<\/Name> <Type>Layout<\/Type> ... <MasterId>123<\/MasterId> <\/BasicMetaData> ... <\/CreateObjects> ``` Enterprise Server stores the new value provided for the `MasterId` in the database and in this example it returns the following response: ```xml <CreateObjectsResponse> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Lock>true<\/Lock> <Objects> <Object> <MetaData> <BasicMetaData> <ID>124<\/ID> <DocumentID>...<\/DocumentID> <Name>SaveAs of layout 123<\/Name> <Type>Layout<\/Type> ... <MasterId>123<\/MasterId> <\/BasicMetaData> ... <\/CreateObjectsResponse> ``` ## Searching for a master and its variants When searching for objects that have a `MasterId` set to a certain value, all variants (copies) of that master and all variants of variants are returned except for the master object itself. To invoke the master as well, the `ID` property should be queried too. However, the `QueryObjects` service won't allow composing such query because when searching for two *different* properties, assumed is that the `AND` operator should be applied. But when searching for two different values of the *same* property the `OR` operator is applied. In other words, searching for \"`ID` = 123 OR `MasterId` = 123\" can not be done with this service. Instead, a Named Query `OriginalObjectsAndVariants` is introduced that that can be called through the `NamedQuery` web service as follows: ```xml <NamedQuery> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <Query>OriginalObjectsAndVariants<\/Query> <Params> <QueryParam> <Property>MasterId<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>123<\/Value> ... <\/QueryParam> <\/Params> ... <\/NamedQuery> ``` ## Related Pages The Publication Overview application in Content Station 11 can show Related Pages of a selected layout page. For this feature the `GetRelatedPages` and `GetRelatedPagesInfo` services are called which make use of the `MasterId` to find out which master and which variants exist for the selected layout page. The services return the master and all its variants regardless whether the selected layout page is a master or a variant. ## Create Print Variant Content Station 11 allows to create a print article (variant object) from a digital article (master object). For that it calls the `CreateObjectOperations` web service to let the Content Station server plug-in create the print variant and to set the `MasterId` for the created print article. As a result, the `MasterId` property of the print article refers to the `ID` property of the digital article. This enables Content Station to find out which print article is created from which digital article and visualise this in the UI and make smarter suggestions which digital articles to place on the layout preview.

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Spelling sortid: 130 permalink: 1050-spelling --- ## Spelling \\[since 7.4\\] > Note that Spelling and Suggestions services are deprecated since Studio Server 10.11. The Multi-Channel Text Editor of Content Station 7.4 includes support for spelling checking. This feature runs through new web services exposed by Enterprise Server 7.4. This feature is about having a consistent spelling checking throughout the whole workflow. For example, once an article is spell-checked by an editor, he\/she puts the article in the next status, indicating the article is ready for publishing. When at that stage the article shows five errors, no matter on which machine or on which editor the article gets opened, it should still show these (and only these) same five errors. Customers are free to choose their favorite spelling engine. Most commonly used engines are integrated and provided as demo server plug-ins. Integrators are able to build their own integration with other engines. For that, a new business connector interface is added to integrate spelling engines: `Enterprise\/server\/interfaces\/plugins\/connectors\/Spelling_EnterpriseConnector.class.php` The supported spelling languages depend on the availability of the dictionaries for the chosen spelling engine. Enterprise should not stand in the way at this point and let system admins freely configure any (or many) of those languages. Since the new configuration is much more advanced, the article\u2019s text might be split into words differently (as a pre-processing step for spelling). As a result, there could be unneeded spelling errors for those two editors. This is a known limitation. Note that also InCopy and InDesign do *not* use the Spelling and Suggestions features as offered by Enterprise Server. Instead, they use their own spelling features as built-in by Adobe. This could lead to spelling differences between the editors. Configurations applied to the ENTERPRISE\\_SPELLING option are returned through the LogOnResponse to Content Station. See the Admin Guide for installation and configuration of spelling integrations. New services are added to the workflow WSDL: CheckSpelling, GetSuggestions and CheckSpellingAndSuggest. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Preview & Copyfit sortid: 140 permalink: 1049-preview-and-copyfit --- ## Preview & Copy-Fit \\[since 7.4\\] Content Station ships an editor that supports multi-channel editing of articles in WCML format. Enterprise Server offers web services Content Station can talk to. A workspace folder can be created at server side to temporary store the article and the layouts it is placed into. Having that in place, previews, PDFs and copy-fit information can be requested. At the back-end, the server integrates Smart Connection for InDesign Server to do the actual previewing, PDF generation and copy-fit calculation for the article being edit. The following features are in place: * Write-To-Fit, Preview and PDF of placed articles. * Write-To-Fit, Preview and PDF of articles derived from article templates. The template must be created from a layout to inherit geometrical information. * Save article at workspace. * Does not create a version in the database. * Also needed for Auto Save feature. * New article vs existing article. * New articles are not stored in database yet, but can be edited (but not previewed). * Creating article from template. * Word\/Char\/Para counts (done client side only). Preview optimizations \\[since 7.4\\]: * Only preview pages on which article is placed. * Only retrieve the current page. Preview optimizations \\[since 9.5\\]: * Save and keep layout in workspace. Reuse layout for succeeding requests. * Save changed article components separately in workspace for fast loading by SC. * Generate previews and copy-fit for changed text components only. * SC for IDS no longer retrieves the brand setup through logon response. * CS editor updates internal versions (GUIDs) of changed stories only. * CS editor and File Transfer Server use the Deflate compression technique to compress WCML articles while transferring them to or from remote locations. The following services are added to the workflow interface (SCEnterprise.wsdl): ``` CreateArticleWorkspace Ticket ID (nil for new articles) Format (\u2018application\/incopyicml\u2019, used for file extension, and for text conversion?) Content (embedded XML, taken from article template) CreateArticleWorkspaceResponse WorkspaceId ``` Since Enterprise Server 9.5, when the ID parameter is provided, the Content parameter can be set to nil. In that case, the latest version of the article is retrieved by Enterprise Server and put into the workspace folder. This saves time for remote workers and\/or large articles. ``` ListArticleWorkspaces (used for recovery only) Ticket ListArticleWorkspacesResponse Workspaces WorkspaceId WorkspaceId ``` ``` GetArticleFromWorkspace (used for recovery only) Ticket WorkspaceId GetArticleFromWorkspaceResponse ID (nil for new articles) Format Content (embedded XML) ``` ``` SaveArticleInWorkspace (used for auto-save only) Ticket WorkspaceId ID (nil for new articles) Format (\u2018application\/incopyicml\u2019, used for file extension, and for text conversion?)

In single page preview mode, the preview pane of the editor displays all pages that contain (a part of) the article only. In Spread Preview mode, when an article is placed on one page of a spread (but not on the sibling page) the sibling page is included too, just to \u2018complete\u2019 the spread view. Related to this feature, when an article text frame runs over two pages of a spread, it should be visualized on -both- pages with a gray box in the preview pane. (Before, only one of the two pages showed the gray box.) In this chapter, the following terms are used: Term | Meaning ---------------:|---------------- spread | Left and right page together (as shown in InDesign). sibling page | The other page of the spread. Talking about the left page, the right page is the sibling page, or vice versa. placement tile | Part of a placement. When placement (text frame) runs over two pages of a spread, it gets \u2018divided\u2019 into two tiles; One tile that fits on the left page and one tile that fits on the right page. Both tiles glued together has the same shape\/dimensions as the placement itself. When an article text frame (from now called \u2018placement\u2019) is placed on one page of the spread, but also partly covers the sibling page, the placement is enriched with two 'tiles'. As long as a placement fits on its page, there are no tiles. When one placement covers two pages, there are two tiles, each with coordinates and dimensions relative to the corresponding page. For a tile, Enterprise keeps track of placement db id, page sequence nr, left, top, width and height. A PlacementTile is new workflow data type added to the SCEnterprise.wsdl. The Placement element has a new property named Tiles, which is a list of PlacementTile elements. When a layout is stored (through CreateObjects \/ SaveObjects services), the Smart Connection plug-ins for InDesign send tile info along with the page placements. This happens only when necessarily; when the placement fits on the page, no tiles are provided. Enterprise Server stores the tiles in the database in a new table, named smart\\_placementtiles. When the layout and article are stored at the server, the Multi-Channel Text Editor of Content Station can request a preview through the PreviewArticleAtWorkspace service. This service has a new parameter named PreviewType, which can be either \u2018page\u2019 or \u2018spread\u2019. In single page preview mode, Content Station sends \u2018page\u2019 and in Spread Preview mode, it sends \u2018spread\u2019. When it comes to preview generation, Enterprise Server calls InDesign Server through SOAP, and feeds its JavaScript module named\u00a0IDPreview.js (which can be found in the server\/apps folder). That module talks through scripting API to InDesign Server and Smart Connection plug-ins. This integration is responsible for returning previews of pages containing article content. Results are written in the composedata.xml file in the user\u2019s workspace folder (server side) along with the generated preview files. So far, nothing new. If an article placement is placed on a spread (for example: one text frame on pages 2 and 3) and the new PreviewType parameter is set to \u2018spread\u2019, IDPreview.js returns previews of -both- pages (one that contains the article, and one that does not). When a placement has tiles, Smart Connection plug-ins provide Tiles information through the frameData JSON. This info is read by IDPreview.js and is written to the composedata.xml. Therefore, the XML structure is expanded with a &lt;tiles&gt; element that may occur inside a &lt;textframe&gt; element. Inside, a list of &lt;tile&gt; elements provides info about the dimension of each placement tile. Enterprise Server (more precisely: the previewArticleAtWorkspace function of BizWebEditWorkspace class) parses the composedata.xml file and composes the Tiles structure returned through the PreviewArticleAtWorkspace service response. Content Station now displays the Spread Preview. The logics behind placing pages left or right are implemented in Content Station. This depends on the reading order. Therefore, the ReversedRead property is introduced in the PublicationInfo and IssueInfo elements in the workflow WSDL (SCEnterprise.wsdl). This reading order info is returned through the LogOn response. For the Publication Overview in Content Station, the placement tiles are also important. Without tiles, Content Station won\u2019t know if a text frame of an article runs over the other page of the spread (or not). Therefore, Enterprise Server returns extra PlacementInfo elements through the GetPages service (as called by Content Station for the Publication Overview). For each placement, but now also for each placement tile, a PlacementInfo exists. When a layout is sent to the Trash Can, the tiles remain in the database (in the smart\\_placementtiles table) so that the tiles are available again when the layout is restored. When a layout is removed permanently (purged), the tiles are removed from the database. ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Trash Can & Clean Up [since 8.0] sortid: 150 permalink: 1052-trashcan-and-cleanup --- Enterprise Server 7.0 allows system admin users to manage deleted objects through the admin pages. Enterprise Server 8.0 exposes that functionality to brand users and end users as well. Users can restore objects or delete objects permanently from the Trash Can. Objects can be owned by Brands, assigned to Issues, classified by Categories, etc. Those entities cannot be removed as long they are occupied by objects, regardless of wether they in the workflow or in the Trash Can. Clean Up features help to move objects elsewhere or delete them. Configuration and migration details of the Trash Can and Auto Purge feature can be found in the Admin Guide. ## Object properties There are two new object properties introduced to track deleted objects: * ***Deleted On (Deleted):*** Date-time stamp when the object has been deleted. Used to filter objects in the Trash Can. This is similar to the Created On (Creator) and Modified On (Modifier) properties. * ***Deleted By (Deleter):*** User who deleted the object. Used to determine which objects reside in the user\u2019s individual Trash Can. This is similar to the Created By (Creator) and Modified By (Modifier) properties. When an object is deleted, both properties will be automatically filled in by the server. When an object is restored, the properties remain untouched, so they provide information on the last delete operation. ## Workflow dialogs Like the Delete operation (and unlike other workflow operations) there is no workflow dialog raised for Restore- and Delete Permanent operations. So there is no dialog configuration for it either. The two new properties (Deleter and Deleted) are determined by the system. Therefore, they are always read-only when shown at workflow dialogs. ## Dialog Setup \/ Query Setup The following changes are made to the Action pull-down menu of the Dialog Setup page: * ***Query Result Columns for Trash Can***: New option used to configure columns to show at the search results of the Trash Can. Unlike other query results, this one allows adding Deleted and Deleter columns. * ***Query Result Columns for Web***: No longer available since the Web pages are superseded by Content Station. * ***Query Result Columns for Smart Browser***: No longer available since Smart Browser is superseded by Content Station. ## Access rights Under the File Access section of the Profile Maintenance page, there is one additional option named \u201cDelete Permanently\u201d (internally called \u201cPurge\u201d). For existing, migrated and new profiles, this option is disabled by default. When enabled, it allows users to remove objects from the Trash Can. The existing profile option \u201cDelete\u201d has an additional meaning. It also indicates whether the user can Restore objects from the Trash Can. Note that access rights options only affect brand admins and end-users. Not system admins. ## Integration The server reports all kinds of problems back to clients so they can ask the user for confirmation or just inform the user to what extent the operation was successful. The server is backwards compatible with 7.x clients which only know about SOAP faults. Those clients simply raise errors instead of confirmations. No objects are listed in the dialogs. The server tries to apply the operation for all objects, even when an error has occurred. The following changes are made to the workflow interface (SCEnterprise.wsdl): * ***AreaType***: New type introduced to filter objects from the Trash Can. Currently supported values are Workflow and Trash. * ***WorkflowMetaData***: Has new object properties: Deleter and Deleted that are set when the object is deleted. * ***QueryObjects***: Request has a new Areas parameter used to query objects from the Trash Can. * ***NamedQueries***: Queries for Trash Can do not travel through Named Queries. Use QueryObjects instead. * ***RestoreObjects***: New service that restores objects from the Trash Can back into the workflow. * ***DeleteObjects service:*** Since deleted objects do not leave the system yet, client applications might want to know what happened (for example to update the Trash Can that is currently still opened in the background). Therefore this service returns objects that are deleted (which is a change). A new \u201cAreas\u201d parameter tells if the object needs to be deleted from the workflow (7.0 behavior) or needs to be deleted permanently from the Trash Can. The combinations of parameter values result in the following system operations: Permanent | Areas | System operation ---------------| ------------------| ---------------------------- 1 | Workflow | Permanently delete 1 | Trash | Permanently delete 1 | Workflow + Trash | Error (not supported) 0 | Workflow | Delete (send to Trash Can) 0 | Trash | Error (makes no sense) 0 | Workflow + Trash | Error (not supported) * ***GetObjects***: Request has a new \u201cAreas\u201d parameter that allows to get the thumbnail and preview for objects listed in Trash Can. * ***GetDialog***: Request has a new \u201cAreas\u201d parameter that allows to get properties for objects listed in Trash Can as configured for the Preview dialog (at Dialog Setup). * ***GetVersion***: Request has a new \u201cAreas\u201d parameter that allows to view a version of an object in the Trash Can. * ***ListVersions***: Request has a new \u201cAreas\u201d parameter that allows to request for all versions of an object in the Trash Can. ## Live updates \/ N-casting To support live updates between Search results, Inbox and Trash Can, some changes have been made to the messages that are broadcasted or multi-casted over the network to all client applications listening for updates: * ***DeleteObject (\\#4)*** - Before Enterprise Server 8.0, the ID was sent only. Since 8.0, the following properties are sent: ID (object), Type (object) \\[1\\], Name (object), PublicationId, IssueIds, EditionIds, SectionId, StateId, Deleted, Deleter, RouteTo (user), LockedBy (user), Version (object), UserId and Permanent \\[9\\]. * \\[9\\] The Permanent property is set \u2018true\u2019 when the object is deleted permanently, or \u2018false\u2019 when the object is deleted (sent to Trash Can). * ***RestoreObject (\\#23)*** - New event, fired for each object that was restored from the Trash Can. Aside from the default set of properties, Deleted and Deleter properties are sent too. ## Server Plug-ins There are new connector types added that can be implemented by connectors of server plug-ins, and for two existing connector types the behavior has changed: * ***WflRestoreObjects\\_EnterpriseConnector\\****: New connector type. Called when user restores objects from the Trash Can. Called only once for multiple selected objects. * ***WflDeleteObjects\\_EnterpriseConnector\\****: Existing connector type. Now also called when a user deletes objects permanently from the Trash Can. So checking the new Areas parameter is required. * ***WflSetObjectProperties\\_EnterpriseConnector***: Existing connector type. Now also called when an admin moves objects from one issue or category to another. Can also be called for objects in the Trash Can. So checking the new Areas parameter is required. For the restore and delete connectors, the new Deleted and Deleter object properties will be set and are accessible through: `$response->Objects[n-1]->MetaData->WorkflowMetaData` Note that for all connectors, the ID, IDs and Params elements are flattened to just IDs. That means, no matter what client applications send, the server will make sure the IDs are set (resolved from others) and others are made null. When IDs is null, it means \u2018for all objects\u2019. ## Handling errors for multiple objects Assume the user has made a multiple selection of some objects and does a Delete or Restore operation, for which some objects have no problems, while some others have errors. **8.0 client with 8.0 server** For a 8.0 client talking to 8.0 server, the SOAP messages looks like the examples below. The initial request: ```xml <DeleteObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <IDs><String>51<\/String><String>52<\/String><String>53<\/String><\/IDs> <Permanent>false<\/Permanent> <Params xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <Areas><Area>Workflow<\/Area><\/Areas> <\/DeleteObjects> ``` The response for which an error dialog and confirmation dialog is raised: ```xml <DeleteObjectsResponse> <IDs> <String>51<\/String> <String>53<\/String> <\/IDs> <Reports> <ErrorReport> <BelongsTo> <Type>Object<\/Type> <ID>52<\/ID> <Name xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <Role xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <\/BelongsTo> <Entries> <ErrorReportEntry> <Entities\/> <Message>Access denied (S1002)<\/Message> <Details\/> <ErrorCode>S1002<\/ErrorCode> <MessageLevel>Warning<\/MessageLevel> <\/ErrorReportEntry> <\/Entries> <\/ErrorReport> <\/Reports> <\/DeleteObjectsResponse> ``` Note that there can still be SOAP faults instead of responses, for example when the ticket has expired. Errors mentioned above are about individual objects causing problems only. **7.x client with 8.0 server** For a 7.x client talking to a 8.0 server, the SOAP messages looks like the examples below. The initial request: ```xml <DeleteObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <IDs><String>51<\/String><String>52<\/String><String>53<\/String><\/IDs> <Permanent>false<\/Permanent> <\/DeleteObjects> ``` The responses for which one error dialog is raised: ```xml <SOAP-ENV:Fault> <faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Client<\/faultcode> <faultstring>Access denied (S1002)\\nObject locked (Sxxxx)<\/faultstring> <faultactor\/> <detail>53 (D)\\n52<\/detail> <\/SOAP-ENV:Fault> ``` As you can see, there is no longer a DeleteObjectsReponse but a true SOAP fault. All errors are collected and returned once. When there are many objects, it would be very hard for users to resolve the problem(s) and retry. This happens during migrations so it is a temporary problem. ## Empty the Trash Can Client applications can use the Params element to implicitly specify all objects that fit in the current search results the user is facing. Or they can use IDs element to explicitly specify the objects the user has selected. For example, some objects selected by the user or, all objects that fit on the first page of the search results. When both IDs and Params elements are set to nil, Permanent is 'true' and Areas is 'Trash', then the entire Trash Can is emptied. To prevent many server plug-ins from having to resolve which object IDs are involved, the server calls QueryObjects internally (on service level) to resolve the IDs. It then passes through the IDs and nullifies the Params element. In other terms, server plug-in may assume that the IDs element is always set. Empty the system\u2019s Trash Can: ```xml <DeleteObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <IDs xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <Permanent>true<\/Permanent> <Params xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <Areas><Area>Trash<\/Area><\/Areas> <\/DeleteObjects> ``` Trash the current query results: ```xml <DeleteObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <IDs xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <Permanent>false<\/Permanent> <Params>...<\/Params> <!-- current query params used --> <Areas><Area>Workflow<\/Area><\/Areas> <\/DeleteObjects> ``` Empty objects from Trash Can that were deleted by someone specific: ```xml <DeleteObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <IDs xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <Permanent>true<\/Permanent> <Params> <Param> <Property>Deleter<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>John<\/Value> <Special xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <\/Param> <\/Params> <Areas><Area>Trash<\/Area><\/Areas> <\/DeleteObjects> ``` Empty objects from Trash Can that are owned by a specific brand: ```xml <DeleteObjects> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <IDs xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <Permanent>true<\/Permanent> <Params> <Param> <Property>PublicationId<\/Property> <Operation>=<\/Operation> <Value>123<\/Value> <Special xsi:nil=\u201dtrue\u201d\/> <\/Param> <\/Params> <Areas><Area>Trash<\/Area><\/Areas> <\/DeleteObjects> ```",

        "category": "",
        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Annotations [since 8.0] sortid: 160 permalink: 1042-annotations --- This chapter describes how the workflow interface\/web services definition (SCEnterprise.wsdl) is extended to support the Annotations feature. Unlike other workflow services, the SendMessages service \u2018does it all\u2019. Where other services are very explicit (create, update, delete), this service looks at the given Message elements and determines what operation to perform (create, update, delete) one by one. When a message exists, it does an update, else a create. When the UserID and ObjectID (of a Message element) are set to zero, a delete operation is performed instead. In fact, the list of passed in Message elements can be seen as a list of commands. This have been the case from the early days of Enterprise, and remains unchanged. Nevertheless, this principle is good to understand before reading this chapter. Since 8.0 the delete operations are made more explicit to distinguish between users deleting messages, and messages marked as \u2018read\u2019 (which is explained in the next chapters). It is by design that placing Sticky Notes on layouts in InDesign are not directly reflected to other users (such as in the Publication Overview in Content Station) until the layout is saved. The other way around, when messaging (n-casting) is enabled, and users edit Sticky Notes (or replies) in the Publication Overview, those changes -are- reflected directly to the layout opened in InDesign. InDesign is responsible for handing conflicts related to Sticky Notes and replies. ## Configuration **Access rights** On the Profile Maintenance page, the \u201cEdit Sticky Notes\u201d option in the Workflow section has been renamed in Enterprise Server 8.0 to \u201cCreate and Reply Sticky Notes\u201d and moved to a new section named \u201cAnnotations\u201d. Two more access rights are added to that section as well: \u201cView Sticky Notes\u201d and \u201cDelete Sticky Notes\u201d. When the \u201cEdit Sticky Notes\u201d was enabled (or disabled) for older Enterprise Server versions, once migrated to Enterprise Server 8.0, \u201cCreate and Reply Sticky Notes\u201d and \u201cDelete Sticky Notes\u201d are automatically set accordingly. The \u201cView Sticky Notes\u201d is always enabled. For newly created profiles, all three access right options under the \u201cAnnotations\u201d section are enabled by default. **Important:** Access rights are checked client side, not server side. Whether certain operations are allowed or not is made clear to end-users immediately instead of for example after an expensive save operation of a layout. In other terms, the web services allow all message operations, as requested by clients. As a result, users working with Smart Connection 7.x or Content Station 7.x are allowed to delete message, while Smart Connection 8.0 \/ Content Station 8.0 could disallow (depending on the configured access rights). This behavior is by design. **Unread messages in Search results** On the Dialog Setup admin page a new column is added named Unread Messages (UnreadMessageCount). This can be added to any of the Query Result Columns. Once configured, it shows the number of Sticky Notes (including replies) that are placed on a layout which aren\u2019t read by anyone yet. (This also includes system messages sent to objects.) Similar to \u201cPlacedOn\u201d and \u201cIssues\u201d, the new property\u00a0\u201cUnreadMessageCount\u201d is a calculated property. This means that its value can only be determined after the object is retrieved from the database. The consequence is that you cannot search\/sort on this property without use of Solr. In case of Solr, searching and sorting is possible as the value of\u00a0\u201cUnreadMessageCount\u201d is indexed by Solr. The user creating Sticky Notes or replies does see them counted as unread messages in the search results too, like anyone else. This is expected behavior: it should be seen as a mark for new messages added to the workflow that needs someones attention when working on those objects. For the Inbox search, users can simply add the Unread Messages column through the GUI of Smart Connection or Content Station: by right-clicking the column header and selecting the column. **Messages in email** See the Admin Guide for how to set up and configure email for Enterprise. The enterprise\/config\/templates folder contains email HTML files. In any of the email template files, you can add the %Messages% tag, which gets replaced by the messages placed on the layout. For example, when a layout is routed to a user, that user will receive an email where the Sticky Notes (and its replies) are already listed in the email. ## Message restructuring \\[since 8.0\\] Since 8.0 a new type is introduced, named \u2018MessageList\u2019: ```xml <complexType name=\"MessageList\"> <all> <element name=\"Messages\" type=\"tns:ArrayOfMessage\" nillable=\"true\" \/> <element name=\"ReadMessageIDs\" type=\"tns:ArrayOfString\" nillable=\"true\" \/> <element name=\"DeleteMessageIDs\" type=\"tns:ArrayOfString\" nillable=\"true\" \/> <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` Basically, all Messages- and ReadMessageIDs properties are replaced with MessageList properties. This affects LogOnResponse, LogOff request, UnlockObjects request, Object, CreateObjects request, SaveObjects request, ObjectPageInfo request, SendMessages request, And, the meaning of ReadMessageIDs has been changed; It no longer means to delete the messages. Instead, there is a new property introduced, named DeleteMessageIDs that does actual deletions. When messages are read by a user, the ReadMessageIDs is used. This is for 8.0 compliant clients talking to a 8.0 server. When 7.x compliant clients are talking, the 8.0 server will detect and change the request on-the-fly in its service layer. **Server Plug-ins: Migration to 8.0 (or newer)** Because the service layer in Enterprise Server takes care of restructuring messages on-the-fly, Server Plug-ins (as well as the core server) do not have to deal with old structures: there is only the new structure to deal with. Nevertheless, this means that old plug-ins needs to be migrated when they intercept the messages. ## User messages Unlike other message types, messages sent to users are delete once read. **SC\/CS 7.x (or older)** A user logs in to the system: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <UserID>woodwing<\/UserID> <MessageID>8547...DD310<\/MessageID> <MessageType>user<\/MessageType> ... <\/Message> <\/Messages> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` A user has read the message and logs off: ```xml <LogOff> ... <ReadMessageIDs> <String>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/ReadMessageIDs> ... <\/LogOff> ``` Note that the ReadMessageIDs indicate that the messages needs to be deleted. Since 8.0 this request is made more explicit, as explained in the next paragraph. **SC\/CS 8.0 (or newer)** A user logs in to the system: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <MessageList> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <UserID>woodwing<\/UserID> <MessageID>8547...DD310<\/MessageID> <MessageType>user<\/MessageType> ... <\/Message> <\/Messages> ... <\/MessageList> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` A user has read the message and logs off: ```xml <LogOff> ... <MessageList> ... <DeleteMessageIDs> <String>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/DeleteMessageIDs> ... <\/MessageList> ... <\/LogOff> ``` Note that for the LogOnResponse, the Server detects the client major version in the ClientAppVersion parameter of the LogOn request. When this version is 8 (or newer), the MessageList structure is used. When the version is 7 (or older), the obsoleted Messages structure is used instead. # Sticky Notes \\[since 4.2\\] Since Enterprise Server 4.2 a new message type is introduced, named \u2018sticky\u2019: ```xml <simpleType name=\"MessageType\"> <restriction base=\"string\"> <enumeration value=\"system\" \/> <enumeration value=\"client\" \/> <enumeration value=\"user\" \/> <enumeration value=\"sticky\" \/> <enumeration value=\"reply\" \/> <\/restriction> <\/simpleType> ``` And, the Message is extended with a property named \u2018StickyInfo\u2019: ```xml <complexType name=\"Message\"> <all> <element name=\"ObjectID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"UserID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"MessageID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> ... <element name=\"StickyInfo\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"tns:StickyInfo\" \/> ... <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` Also, the StickyInfo type definition is introduced: ```xml <complexType name=\"StickyInfo\"> <all> <element name=\"AnchorX\" type=\"xsd:double\" \/> <element name=\"AnchorY\" type=\"xsd:double\" \/> <element name=\"Left\" type=\"xsd:double\" \/> <element name=\"Top\" type=\"xsd:double\" \/> <element name=\"Width\" type=\"xsd:double\" \/> <element name=\"Height\" type=\"xsd:double\" \/> <element name=\"Page\" type=\"xsd:unsignedInt\" nillable=\"true\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\" \/> <element name=\"Version\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"Color\" type=\"tns:Color\" \/> <element name=\"PageSequence\" type=\"xsd:unsignedInt\" \/> <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` **Smart Connection: Place new Sticky Note on a page** _**Smart Connection 7.x (or older)**_ In InDesign (or InCopy), the user places a Sticky Note on a page and saves the layout: ```xml <SaveObjects> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID>27<\/ObjectID> <UserID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageID>8547...DD310<\/MessageID>

<\/SaveObjects> ``` **_Smart Connection 8.0 (or newer)_** In InDesign (or InCopy), the user places a Sticky Note on a page and saves the layout: ```xml <SaveObjects> ... <Objects> <Object> ...

Station: Place a new Sticky Note on a page** **_Content Station 7.x (or older)_** On the Publication Overview, the user places a Sticky Note on a page: ```xml <SendMessages> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID>10<\/ObjectID> <UserID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageID><\/MessageID> <MessageType>sticky<\/MessageType> <MessageTypeDetail><\/MessageTypeDetail> <Message>The text does not fit

<\/MessageList> ... <\/SendMessages> ``` ## Reply to a message \\[since 8.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 8.0, a new message type is introduced, named \u2018reply\u2019: ```xml <simpleType name=\"MessageType\"> <restriction base=\"string\"> <enumeration value=\"system\" \/> <enumeration value=\"client\" \/> <enumeration value=\"user\" \/> <enumeration value=\"sticky\" \/> <enumeration value=\"reply\" \/> <\/restriction> <\/simpleType> ``` And, the Message is extended with two properties, named \u2018ThreadMessageID\u2019 and \u2018ReplyToMessageID\u2019: ```xml <complexType name=\"Message\"> <all> <element name=\"ObjectID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"UserID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"MessageID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> ... <element name=\"ThreadMessageID\" type=\"xsd:string\" nillable=\"true\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\" \/> <element name=\"ReplyToMessageID\" type=\"xsd:string\" nillable=\"true\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\" \/> ... <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` Note that ThreadMessageID and ReplyToMessageID are made optional to support 7.6 clients talking to a 8.0 server. In future versions this might become mandatory (but remains nillable). Although hierarchy in message replies is not required for 8.0, the data model is prepared for this future feature. For the GUI, a flat list can be shown, and in future versions, this can be made more advanced by showing a hierarchy. Once a Sticky Note is placed, users can reply. The Sticky Note can be seen as the initiator of a \u2018thread\u2019. The sticky message has StickyInfo, but the replies don\u2019t (set to nil). The sticky message has ReplyToMessageID set to zero, but replies have set it to the message ID of the previous reply or sticky. The sticky message and the replies have the ThreadID set to the sticky message ID. **Smart Connection: Reply to a Sticky Note on a page** In InDesign (or InCopy), the user replies at a Sticky Note on a page and saves the layout: ```xml <SaveObjects> ... <Objects> <Object> <MessageList> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID>27<\/ObjectID> <UserID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageID>6EFE668F-...-4823E18B9EBF<\/MessageID> <MessageType>reply<\/MessageType> <MessageTypeDetail><\/MessageTypeDetail> <Message>I have made the text fit now.<\/Message> <TimeStamp>2012-03-14T12:45:00<\/TimeStamp> <Expiration xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageLevel xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <FromUser>woodwing<\/FromUser> <StickyInfo xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <ThreadMessageID>8547...DD310<\/ThreadMessageID> <ReplyToMessageID>8547...DD310<\/ReplyToMessageID> <MessageStatus>None<\/MessageStatus> <\/Message> <\/Messages> ... <\/MessageList> <\/Object> <\/Objects> ... <\/SaveObjects> ``` Note that messages are hierarchical. The ThreadMessageID points to the initial Sticky Note. The ReplyToMessageID points to the message the user reacts on. For the first reply, these two ids are the same. For following replies the ThreadMessageID remains the same, but ReplyToMessageID could point to the Sticky Note or any of the replies. The request is composed in human reading order to simplify parsing it server side (by core or plug-ins), and so it may assumed that the two ids always refer back to messages listed \u2018earlier\u2019. **Content Station: Reply to a Sticky Note on a page** In the Publication Overview, the user replies to a Sticky Note on a page: ```xml <SendMessages> ... <MessageList> ... <Messages> ... <Message> <ObjectID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <UserID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageID>6EFE668F-41ED-A226-4823E18B9EBF<\/MessageID> <MessageType>reply<\/MessageType> <MessageTypeDetail><\/MessageTypeDetail> <Message>I have made the text fit now.<\/Message> <TimeStamp>2012-03-14T12:45:00<\/TimeStamp> <Expiration xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageLevel xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <FromUser>woodwing<\/FromUser> <StickyInfo xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <ThreadMessageID>8547...DD310<\/ThreadMessageID> <ReplyToMessageID>8547...DD310<\/ReplyToMessageID> <MessageStatus>None<\/MessageStatus> <\/Message> ... <\/Messages> ... <\/MessageList> ... <\/SendMessages> ``` **Modify a Sticky Note (since 4.2) or a reply \\[since 8.0\\]** In InDesign (or InCopy) and\/or in the Publication Overview of Content Station, when a user changes the text on their own replies the same request is sent as during the creation (except that the data is updated). The same happens when a user moves the Sticky Note or its anchor. Note that this is only allowed when there are no replies to the message being modified. In other terms, if another user has replied in the meantime, the message can no longer be modified. The server throws an error on such an attempt but only for SendMessages service (called by Content Station). The last update \/ operation for a message \u2018wins\u2019. So when user A updates all messages on a page, just after user B has updated his\/her own message, the update of user A overwrites the update of user B. This was for 7.x (or older) a bigger problem than for 8.0 (or newer) since users are only allowed to update their own messages. Nevertheless, Smart Connection and Content Station therefore never send messages of other users, other than the messages of the current user. And, they only send messages that are really updated. Untouched messages are never sent to the server. Also, when sending messages, their properties are set to nil as much as possible (but, obviously respecting the WSDL) to avoid undoing earlier made changes. **Delete a Sticky Note (since 4.2) or a reply \\[since 8.0\\]** **_Smart Connection 7.x (or older)_** In InDesign (or InCopy), the user deletes a Sticky Note or reply: ```xml <SaveObjects> ... <ReadMessageIDs> <String\/>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/ReadMessageIDs> ... <\/SaveObjects> ``` Note that the ReadMessageIDs indicate that the messages needs to be deleted. Since 8.0 this request is made more explicit as written in next paragraph. _**Smart Connection 8.0 (or newer)**_ In InDesign (or InCopy), the user deletes a Sticky Note or reply: ```xml <SaveObjects> ... <Objects> <Object> ... <MessageList> ... <DeleteMessageIDs> <String\/>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/DeleteMessageIDs> ... <\/MessageList> ... <\/Object> <\/Objects> ... <\/SaveObjects> ``` **_Content Station 7.x (or older)_** In the Publication Overview, the user deletes a Sticky Note or reply: ```xml <SendMessages> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID>0<\/ObjectID> <UserID>0<\/UserID> <MessageID>8547...DD310<\/MessageID> <MessageType>sticky<\/MessageType> ... <\/Message> <\/Messages> <\/SendMessages> ``` Note that when both ObjectID and UserID are set to zero, the message gets deleted (from the database). Since 8.0 this request is made more explicit as written in next paragraph. **_Content Station 8.0 (or newer)_** In the Publication Overview, the user deletes a Sticky Note or reply: ```xml <SendMessages> ... <MessageList> ... <DeleteMessageIDs> <String\/>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/DeleteMessageIDs> ... <\/MessageList> <\/SendMessages> ``` **_Server Plug-ins: Migration to Enterprise Server 8.0 (or newer)_** Custom server plug-ins designed for Enterprise Server 7.x (or older) that implement the SendMessages connector to detect message deletions need to be migrated to the 8.0 method. The service layer transforms old service requests into new service requests, so the connectors will be called in the 8.0 way, regardless of how it gets called by clients. **_Exceptions_** Note that deleting replies is only allowed when there are no other replies to it. In other terms, if another user has replied in the meantime, the message can no longer be deleted. The server throws an error on such attempt for SendMessages (Content Station), but not for SaveObjects (Smart Connection). ## Mark as read \\[since 8.0\\] **Smart Connection: Mark a Sticky Note (or a reply) as read** In InDesign (or InCopy), the user opens a layout that contains a Sticky Note: ```xml <GetObjectsResponse> ... <Objects> <Object> ... <MessageList> ... <Messages> <Message> <ObjectID>27<\/ObjectID> <UserID xsi:nil=\"true\" \/> <MessageID>8547...DD310<\/MessageID> <MessageType>sticky<\/MessageType> ... <\/Message> <\/Messages> <ReadMessageIDs><\/ReadMessageIDs> ... <\/MessageList> ... <\/Object> <\/Objects> ... <\/GetObjectsResponse> ``` > Note that for the GetObjectsResponse, the Server detects the client major version in the ClientAppVersion parameter of the LogOn request. When this version is 8 (or newer), the MessageList structure is used. When the version is 7 (or older), the obsoleted Messages structure is used instead. In InDesign (or InCopy), the user marks a reply (to a Sticky Note on a page) as \u2018read\u2019 and saves the layout: ```xml <SaveObjects> ... <Objects> <Object> ... <MessageList> ... <ReadMessageIDs> <String\/>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/ReadMessageIDs> ... <\/MessageList> ... <\/Object> <\/Objects> ... <\/SaveObjects> ``` **Content Station: Mark Sticky Note (or a reply) as read** In the Publication Overview, the user opens a preview that contains Sticky Notes and marks a Sticky Note as \u2018read\u2019: ```xml <SendMessages> ... <MessageList> ... <ReadMessageIDs> <String\/>8547...DD310<\/String> <\/ReadMessageIDs> ... <\/MessageList> <\/SendMessages> ``` ## Message workflow \\[since 8.0\\] To implement a basic workflow for messages, the Message is extended with MessageStatus: ```xml <complexType name=\"Message\"> <all> <element name=\"ObjectID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"UserID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"MessageID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> ... <element name=\"MessageStatus\" type=\"tns:MessageStatus\" nillable=\"true\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"\/> ... <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` Note that the MessageStatus is made optional to support 7.6 clients talking to a 8.0 server. The message can follow these statuses: ```xml <simpleType name=\"MessageStatus\"> <restriction base=\"string\"> <enumeration value=\"None\" \/> <enumeration value=\"Accepted\" \/> <enumeration value=\"Cancelled\" \/> <enumeration value=\"Completed\" \/> <enumeration value=\"Rejected\" \/> <\/restriction> <\/simpleType> ``` Note that message statuses are pre-defined and cannot be customized. ## History trail for Sticky Notes and replies \\[since 8.0\\] To track for which object version a message was created, the Message is extended with ObjectVersion: ```xml <complexType name=\"Message\"> <all> <element name=\"ObjectID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"UserID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> <element name=\"MessageID\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\" \/> ... <element name=\"ObjectVersion\" type=\"xsd:string\" nillable=\"true\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"\/> ... <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` To allow 7.6 clients talking to a 8.0 server, the ObjectVersion property is made optional. 7.6 clients send no ObjectVersion, but 8.0 clients send an ObjectVersion set to nil. The reason is that for a future version this property will be made mandatory (but remains nillable). When a Message is sent along with the CreateObjects or SaveObjects requests (fired by Smart Connection), the ObjectVersion is nil to let the Server determine and fill-in the created object version just before storing the message in the database. When a Message sent along the SendMessages request (fired by Publication Overview), the ObjectVersion is pre-filled by Content Station. The reason is that the user intension is to put the Sticky Note on the particular version he\/she is looking at. So the version in known ahead of the operation. ## Implicit deletion of Sticky Notes and replies Some cases exist whereby Sticky Notes and replies are deleted implicitly. **On deletion of an object** When an object is sent to the Trash Can, nothing happens to the Sticky Notes nor their replies. But when the object gets removed from Trash Can (purged), they all get removed too. **On deletion of a user** This hardly happens, but the system administrator can remove a user (although it is a preferred method to de-activate users instead). Sticky Notes and their replies will -not- be removed from the layout pages implicitly. But, messages sent to the user that is removed, are removed implicitly. Basically, messages can be sent from a user who does no longer exist in the system. But for messages sent to a user, that user must exist. For all the above, the same counts for user groups. **On deletion of a Sticky Note** Deleting a Sticky Note implicitly deletes all its replies. **Planning integration** 3rd-party planning systems (such as Journal Designer) connect through the planning interface (SmartEditorialPlan.wsdl), just like the clientplan.php tool (in the wwtest folder). Doing so, the Server sends messages to the layouts and adverts that are created or modified. Those messages are shown in a dialog in InDesign when opening the layout (for example with placed adverts). Those messages have the MessageType set to \u2018system\u2019 and MessageTypeDetail set to the operation, such as \u2018ModifyLayout\u2019. ## Exceptions The SendMessages service (as called by Content Station) can throw various types of errors. There are all kinds of exceptional situations that can occur in production: * User A could purge a layout while user B is replying to a Sticky Note on one of the pages. * User A modifies his\/her last reply while user B is replying to it. * ... The SaveObjects service (as called by Smart Connection) does -not- throw errors for message related problems. This is to avoid failures on expensive save operations (especially for layouts). Nevertheless, erratic messages are skipped to make sure all messages are at least handled. ## Access rights The access rights listed in the table below are related to annotations: The actual values configured on the admin pages are returned through LogOn web service and are checked client side. **access right** | **internal name** | **introduced since** | **default value** ---------------------------------| -------------------| ----------------------| ------------------- Create and Reply Sticky Notes\\* | EditStickyNotes | 4.2 | enabled View Sticky Notes | ViewNotes | 8.0 | enabled Delete Sticky Notes | DeleteNotes | 8.0 | enabled > \\* Since 8.0, the access right \u201cEdit Sticky Notes\u201d is renamed to \u201cCreate and Reply Sticky Notes\u201d, as shown on the Profiles Maintenance admin page. However, the internal name (communicated from server to clients) still remains the same, which is \u201cEditStickyNotes\u201d. This is done for backwards compatibility reasons (version 7 client talking to version 8 server). Through the LogOnResponse, only differences compared to the default values are sent to clients. In other terms, when admin user did not change the default, nothing is sent. Since all three access rights options enabled by default, when the admin user disables one of these options, only those are returned. For example, when all three options are disabled by the admin user, the following is returned: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <FeatureProfiles> ... <FeatureProfile> <Name>My Profile<\/Name> <Features> ... <AppFeature> <Name>ViewNotes<\/Name> <Value>No<\/Value> <\/AppFeature> <AppFeature> <Name>EditStickyNotes<\/Name> <Value>No<\/Value> <\/AppFeature> <AppFeature> <Name>DeleteNotes<\/Name> <Value>No<\/Value> <\/AppFeature> ... <\/Features> <\/FeatureProfile> ... <\/FeatureProfiles> ... <\/LogOnResponse> ``` ## n-cast messaging With n-casting (broadcasting \/ multicasting) enabled, changes to messages are directly reflected between the InDesign layout and the Publication Overview. This is convenient, but also avoids data loss. It is expected that when user A saves a layout, after user B has made changes to Sticky Notes in the Publication Overview, that the changes of user A overwrite the changes of user B. Chances that such a thing happens are slim when n-casting is enabled. Obviously, for remote workers this cannot be enabled, and so chances are relatively bigger. The Messaging Specification gives full detail of n-casted messages and their fields. Since 8.0, the following fields are added to the SendMessage event: ThreadMessageID, ReplyToMessageID, MessageStatus, ObjectVersion and IsRead (boolean). ",

Once a label is created, it can be updated (renamed) or deleted for the Dossier. When a Dossier gets created (CreateObjects) it inherits the labels from its template. The following example creates a \u2018Foo\u2019 label for a Dossier: ```xml <CreateObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Ticket>...<\/Ticket> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectId>123<\/ObjectId> <!-- Dossier Id--> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Id xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Name>Foo<\/Name> <!-- The name of the Dossier label --> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabels> <\/CreateObjectLabels> ``` ```xml <CreateObjectLabelsResponse> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Id>1<\/Id> <!-- The id of the created label --> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Name>Foo<\/Name> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabels> <\/CreateObjectLabelsResponse> ``` This is how to rename the \u2018Foo\u2019 label into a \u2018Bar\u2019 label: ```xml <UpdateObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Ticket>...<\/Ticket> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Id>1<\/Id> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Name>Foo<\/Name> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabels> <\/UpdateObjectLabels> ``` ```xml <UpdateObjectLabelsResponse> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Id>1<\/Id> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Name>Bar<\/Name> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabels> <\/UpdateObjectLabelsResponse> ``` Deleting the label goes like this: ```xml <DeleteObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Ticket>...<\/Ticket> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Id>1<\/Id> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Name xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabel> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/ObjectLabels> <\/DeleteObjectLabels> ``` ```xml <DeleteObjectLabelsResponse\/> ``` When an object is contained by a Dossier, the object can be labelled as well. However, only labels that were created for the parent Dossier can be chosen. They therefore travel with the \u2018contained\u2019 object relation (with Dossier as parent and the object as child) whereas labels for Dossiers travel directly with the object. For contained objects we speak of \u2018adding\u2019 and \u2018removing\u2019 labels (instead of \u2018creating\u2019 and \u2018deleting\u2019). These operations work with labels that already exist for the parent Dossier of the contained object. This is how to add an existing label to a contained object: ```xml <AddObjectLabels> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Ticket>...<\/Ticket> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<ParentId>123<\/ParentId> <!-- Dossier Id-->

For a functional explanation of these two features and how to set them up, see the 'Tags' section of the *Enterprise Server Online Help*. Enterprise Server offers two new connector interfaces for Server Plug-ins to implement: * A suggestions connector interface (SuggestionProvider\\_EnterpriseConnector) * An auto-complete connector interface (AutocompleteProvider\\_EnterpriseConnector) When a plug-in implements the suggestions connector interface, it becomes a suggestions provider. And, when implementing the auto-complete connector interface, it becomes an auto-complete provider. For example: the OpenCalais plug-in is a suggestion provider, and the Drupal7 plug-in is an auto-complete provider. When a user opens a Publish Form, Enterprise Server requests the installed providers whether or not they support all custom object properties that are configured for that form and includes these in the response. The following example shows these attributes in bold: ```xml <GetDialog2Response> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Tabs> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<DialogWidget> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<PropertyInfo> <!-- metadata setup --> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<Name>C_DRUPAL_CITIES<\/Name> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<!-- 9.1 --> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<TermEntity>Cities<\/TermEntity> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<SuggestionEntity>City<\/SuggestionEntity> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<AutocompleteProvider>Drupal7<\/AutocompleteProvider> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<SuggestionProvider>OpenCalais<\/SuggestionProvider> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0... ``` The property attributes explained: * ***TermEntity:*** Abstract name for a term. When given, it could be recognized by any auto-complete provider to help the user filling in the property. * ***SuggestionEntity:*** Abstract name for a Suggestion. It defines the entity for the types of tags that need to be suggested by the Suggestion Provider, such as 'City', 'Movie', 'TVShow' and so on.\\ * Note that suggestion providers are loosely coupled regarding the publishing providers. For example, OpenCalais and Drupal integrations do not need to know from each other. The challenge here is that for a custom object property, only the publishing connector and the external publishing system know what it is about. For example, a Cities field from Drupal, the custom property could be named C\\_DRUPAL\\_CITIES, which means nothing to OpenCalais. To tackle this challenge, a new attribute is added to the *PropertyInfo* element and is named *SuggestionEntity*. Having this abstract information in place, both integrated systems know where the property stands for. * ***AutocompleteProvider:*** The internal name of the Server Plug-in that has an auto-complete connector that supports this custom object property. * ***SuggestionProvider:*** The internal name of the Server Plug-in that has an auto-complete connector that supports this custom object property. ## Auto-complete Now the Publish Form is shown, the user can fill in the field. Let\u2019s say that the user has already tagged \"Amsterdam\" in the Cities field of the Publish Form. Now the user \u00a0types \"Ams\" to create another tag.

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Download files directly from Content Source [since 9.7] sortid: 190 permalink: 1045-download-from-contentsource --- In Enterprise Server 9.7, improvements have been made in order to make communications with external file sources faster. It allows for clients to request direct file links to a Content Source, with which they can download file content directly from the Content Source, instead of it having to go through Enterprise Server first. This omits Enterprise Server having to download the file content from the Content Source to a temporary folder and sending it to the requestor through DIME or Transfer Server. In order to facilitate this new feature, the *GetObjects* service has been expanded with two extra options: * ***RequestInfo*** has been expanded with a *ContentSourceFileLinks* option. Setting this option tells Enterprise Server that direct content source file links are requested by the client. * ***SupportedContentSources*** has been added as a property. It contains a list of Content Sources that the requestor can directly access in order to download the file content.\\ Note: If the requested object does not match any of the content sources given here, Enterprise will default to the old behaviour. Aside from this, the *Attachment* element has a new *ContentSourceFileLink* property. This property may contain a direct link to the Content Source file when this has been requested. Below is an example using Elvis as the Content Source. Requesting an object that originates from Elvis can be done as follows: ```xml <GetObjectsRequest> ... <RequestInfo>ContentSourceFileLinks<\/RequestInfo> ... <SupportedContentSources>ELVIS<\/SupportedContentSources> ... <\/GetObjectsRequest> ``` Which returns a response like the following: ```xml <GetObjectsResponse> <Objects> <Object> ... <Files> <Attachment> ... <FileUrl xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> ... <ContentSourceFileLink>http:\/\/...<\/ContentSourceFileLink> ... <\/Attachment> ... <\/Files> ... <\/Object> <Objects> <\/GetObjectsResponse> ``` When talking to an older version of Enterprise Server or when the direct download feature is not supported by the Content Source, the returned *ContentSourceFileLink* is set to nil. In that case, the client should fall back to the *FileUrl* or *Content* elements instead to download the file via resp. the File Transfer Server or Enterprise Server (DIME). ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Automated Print Workflow [since 9.8] sortid: 200 permalink: 1043-automated-print-workflow --- This feature is about Images and Articles contained in a Dossier that can be automatically placed on a Layout without the need to open the document in the InDesign client. To make this happen, text frames and graphic frames on the Layout should be labelled with Element Labels and grouped into so-called InDesign Articles. The feature requires the following minimum versions: * Enterprise Server 9.8.0 * Smart Connection 10.2.1 for ID\/IDS CC2014 * Content Station 9.8.0 ### Prepare layouts When saving a Layout in Smart Connection the InDesign Articles and their frames are communicated to Enterprise Server: ```xml <SaveObjects> <Objects> <Object> ... <Relations> <Relation> ... <Placements> ... ... <Placements> ... <InDesignArticles> <InDesignArticle> <Id>246<\/Id> <NameArticle 1<\/Name> <\/InDesignArticle> ... ``` In the *Object* structure there are two places where *Placements* can be found. If a frame contains a text component of an Enterprise Article object or a graphic of an Enterprise Image object, it is defined under *Objects-&gt;Relations-&gt;Placements*. Or else, when the frame belongs to any of the InDesign Articles of the layout, it is defined under *Object-&gt;Placements*. This way, one frame will never be communicated in both places. ### Place dossier The contents of a Dossier can be placed on a Layout. The user clicks the Create Layout button in the channel view of a Dossier and picks a Layout. Content Station requests for the available InDesign Articles for that layout as follows: ```xml <GetObjects> ... <RequestInfo> <String>InDesignArticles<\/String> ... ... ``` Enterprise Server returns the InDesign Articles: ```xml <GetObjectsResponse> <Objects> <Object> ... <InDesignArticles> <InDesignArticle> <Id>246<\/Id> <NameArticle 1<\/Name> <\/InDesignArticle> ... ``` The user picks one of the listed InDesign Articles. Content Station can not edit Layouts. Instead, it locks the Layout for editing (LockObjects) and indirectly \u2018places\u2019 the Dossier on the Layout by creating an Operation for the Layout: ```xml <CreateObjectOperations> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <HaveVersion> <ID>1178<\/ID> <Version>0.2<\/Version> <\/HaveVersion> <Operations> <ObjectOperation> <Id>9f7dd5f4-281a-e885-3707-b642faa3c248<\/Id> <Name>PlaceDossier<\/Name> <Type>AutomatedPrintWorkflow<\/Type> <Params> <Param> <Name> => EditionId <Value> => 1 <\/Param> <Param> <Name> => DossierId <Value> => 1181 <\/Param> <Param> <Name> => InDesignArticleId <Value> => 246 <\/Param> <\/Params> <\/ObjectOperation> <\/Operations> <\/CreateObjectOperations> ``` Note: Instead of picking a Layout, the user can pick a Layout Template. In that case Content Stations calls the *InstantiateTemplate* service instead. The server queries for any server plug-in connectors that implement this interface: > *AutomatedPrintWorkflow\\_EnterpriseConnector* For each connector found, it calls the *resolveOperation()* function to let the connector change the Operations (when needed) before they are actually stored in the database for the Layout. In this example, the *AutomatedPrintWorkflow* plug-in is installed which queries the database and finds out that the Dossier has one Article text component and one Image that could be matched with the InDesign Article of the Layout. Therefore it \u2018resolves\u2019 the *PlaceDossier* operation into two other operations, *PlaceArticleElement* and *PlaceImage*. ```xml <CreateObjectOperationsResponse> ... <Operations> <ObjectOperation> <Id>08a8d9e6-236f-57f4-e677-e71ab95e77f6<\/Id> <Name>PlaceArticleElement<\/Name> <Type>AutomatedPrintWorkflow<\/Type> <Params>...<\/Params> <\/ObjectOperation> <ObjectOperation> <Id>1cd68eb0-d5d2-6e05-c68a-e88e64fb1c3a<\/Id> <Name>PlaceImage<\/Name> <Type>AutomatedPrintWorkflow<\/Type> <Params>...<\/Params> <\/ObjectOperation> <\/Operations> <\/CreateObjectOperations> ``` After a while, Content Station releases the Layout lock (UnlockObjects) to give way for further processing. When the IDS Automation feature is enabled, an *IDS\\_AUTOMATION* job is created during the Operation creation. This job gets picked up from the queue and is processed in the background. Basically it requests InDesign Server (through SOAP) to run a very simple Javascript module (indesignserverjob.jsx). The script requests Smart Connection to LogOn, open and save the Layout and LogOff again. This is to let Smart Connection for InDesign Server process the Object Operations for the Layout. After Smart Connection does the LogOn, it also requests (through the admin web services) for any so-called sub-applications: ```xml <GetSubApplicationsRequest> <Ticket>...<\/Ticket> <ClientAppName>InDesign Server<\/ClientAppName> <\/GetSubApplicationsRequest> ``` In this example, the *AutomatedPrintWorkflow* plug-in hooks in the *runAfter()* function of this web service and provides a JavaScript module that is provided by a server plug-in: ```xml <GetSubApplicationsResponse> <SubApplications> <SubApplication> <ID>SmartConnectionScripts_AutomatedPrintWorkflow<\/ID> <Version>1.6<\/Version> <PackageUrl> http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/Enterprise\/server\/plugins\/AutomatedPrintWorkflow\/idscripts.zip <\/PackageUrl> <DisplayName>Automated Print Workflow<\/DisplayName> <ClientAppName>InDesign Server<\/ClientAppName> <\/SubApplication> <\/SubApplications> <\/GetSubApplicationsResponse> ``` Smart Connection downloads and extracts the package that contains a JavaScript module and loads it into IDS. The indesignserverjob.jsx script is still running and continues with opening the Layout. While opening, Smart Connection downloads and locks the Layout for editing. It finds the Operations sent along with the Layout (GetObjects) and provides those Operations to the JavaScript module. The module uses the information of the Operations to do the actual placing. In the example, this is where the Article text components and the Images are placed. The script continues and saves the Layout. Smart Connection generates page previews and PDFs (if needed) and creates a new version in Enterprise and releases the lock. When the IDS Automation feature is disabled, the Layout does not get processed directly, but has to wait until someone opens the Layout in InDesign client. Then the exact process takes place in InDesign client as described above for InDesign Server. It could happen that many operations are created before the Layout gets opened. That slows down opening the Layout since all those operations needs to be processed. For this performance reason it is recommended to enable the IDS Automation feature when the Automated Print Workflow feature is enabled. ### Customizations As you may have noticed in the previous paragraph, the Automated Print Workflow feature is built into a server plug-in. While Enterprise introduces a mechanism to build such a feature, it also provides the *AutomatedPrintWorkflow* plug-in that implements the default behaviour (business logics) and does place operations. Basically, all you need is a server plug-in that provides a server module and client module. The server module queries the text components and images in the database and the client module places them in the InDesign Article frames. This allows you to: * Disable the *AutomatedPrintWorkflow* plug-in and build your own solution with different or customer specific business logics that determines which text component or image should be placed on which InDesign Article frame. * Add another plug-in that introduces more operations. See also *example on Labs*. ### Default behaviour The *AutomatedPrintWorkflow* plug-in implements the default behaviour. It works when Element Labels are unique within each InDesign Article (e.g. there should be one head, intro, body and graphic) and unique within Dossiers. It has the following reasoning: 1. Resolve the Layout frames that belong to the selected InDesign Article. 1. Exclude duplicate InDesign Article frames; Those can not be uniquely matched. 1. Collect frame types (graphic or text) from the resolved InDesign Article frames. 1. Determine object types (Article, Image) that are compatible with the frame types. 1. Take the Issue to which the Layout is assigned to and take the Edition from the InDesign Article frame. 1. Search in the Dossier for Articles and Images that are assigned to the same Issue and Edition via the Dossier (relational targets). 1. Exclude Articles and Images for which the user has no read access rights. 1. Exclude Articles and Images in Personal status and routed to another user. 1. Exclude Articles that are placed already and the user has no Allow Multiple Article Placements access rights. 1. For each candidate Article: 1. Resolve the Layout frames (placements) of the found Article. 1. Exclude frames with duplicate element label; Those can not be uniquely matched. 1. Exclude graphic frames; This is not supported by Smart Connection. 1. Exclude frame when the same frame label also exists in the same or other Article. 1. Match the frame element labels with the InDesign Article frame element labels. 1. For each candidate Image: 1. Only make a match when InDesign Article has one graphic frame and exactly one Image was found in the Dossier. 1. For each match that could be made, add new Object Operations to the Layout. 1. For each frame that could not be matched, add the *ClearFrameContent* operation. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: User Settings sortid: 210 permalink: 1059-user-settings --- User settings are stored in Enterprise per user per client application. A user setting can be any kind of data the client application wants to make persistent for the user (for example: user defined queries, recently opened tabs or panels, the dossiers the user is working on, etc). The client can choose between two different flows to handle the user settings. The next chapter describes the original, more rigid flow. The succeeding chapter describes a more dynamic flow which gives a better performance and is a better choice for web applications. ## Rigid flow (old, deprecated) User settings can be returned through LogOn response and saved through LogOff request. During the years more and more information is added to the LogOn response which has made it an expensive service. It is more efficient to have smaller web services that can be called after the logon so the end-user does not need to wait before he\/she can get started with the client application. If your client is using this rigid flow, please consider migrating to the dynamic flow to offload the user settings from the LogOn response. Note that in this flow it is allowed to have duplicate settings. For example, when SC saves the settings, the 'QueryPanel' setting may occur multiple times. ### LogOn Client requests for all the user settings stored in the database. ```json { ... \"RequestInfo\": [ \"Settings\" ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnRequest\" } ``` ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Foo1\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" }, { \"Setting\": \"Bar\", \"Value\": \"123\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnResponse\" } ``` ### LogOff Client provides a new collection of user settings. The `Foo1` setting will be removed, the `Foo2` setting will be added, and the `Bar` setting will be updated. ```json { ... \"SaveSettings\": true, \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Foo2\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" }, { \"Setting\": \"Bar\", \"Value\": \"456\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOffRequest\" } ``` ## Dynamic flow (new, preferred) [since 10.3] User settings are retrieved from Enterprise as soon as the client needs to access them. And they are saved to Enterprise whenever the settings are changed. In this flow, duplicate settings are not allowed; the name of each setting is assumed to be unique (per user\/client). Note that when migrating from the old- to the new flow this is something to take into consideration. It is the responsibility of the client to remove duplicate settings and start using unique settings. ### LogOn Client tells that settings are *not* managed through LogOn\/LogOff. ```json { ... \"RequestInfo\": [], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnRequest\" } ``` Because in the RequestInfo the `Settings` are missing, the server does not resolve them: ```json { ... \"Settings\": null, ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnResponse\" } ``` ### LogOn: migration Since 10.3 the `PreferNoSettings` option is added which enables client applications handling user settings through the LogOn\/LogOff services to migrate to the GetUserSettings\/SaveUserSettings services that are introduced with ES 10.3 and meanwhile support both 10.2 and 10.3. By passing both `Settings` and `PreferNoSettings` options, ES 10.2 returns the settings through the LogOnResponse->Settings while ES 10.3 does not. The client can check if LogOnResponse->ServerInfo->Version is 10.3 or higher and call the new GetUserSettings services instead. ```json { ... \"RequestInfo\": [ \"Settings\", \"PreferNoSettings\" ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnRequest\" } ``` ES 10.2 response: ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Foo1\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" }, { \"Setting\": \"Bar\", \"Value\": \"123\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnResponse\" } ``` ES 10.3 response: ```json { ... \"Settings\": null, ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOnResponse\" } ``` ### GetUserSettings: get all settings Client retrieves all user settings at once: ```json { ... \"Settings\": null, \"__classname__\": \"WflGetUserSettingsRequest\" } ``` Basically, this gives the same collection of results as through the LogOn response: ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Foo1\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" }, { \"Setting\": \"Bar\", \"Value\": \"123\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflGetUserSettingsResponse\" } ``` Note that when the client has subapplications (such as the Publication Overview of Content Station) the settings could be prefixed by the client. To reduce the number of settings, it is advisable not to use the method described above, but to explicitly request for the settings that are supported by the client (sub)application as described in the next paragraph. ### GetUserSettings: get specific settings Client (sub)application requests for the settings it supports: ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ \"Bar\" ], \"__classname__\": \"WflGetUserSettingsRequest\" } ``` Only requested settings are returned: ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Bar\", \"Value\": \"123\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflGetUserSettingsResponse\" } ``` ### GetUserSettings: get prefixed settings Client requests for all user settings with a specific prefix: ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ \"Foo%\" ], \"__classname__\": \"WflGetUserSettingsRequest\" } ``` All user settings prefixed with `Foo` are returned: ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Foo1\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" }, { \"Setting\": \"Foo2\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflGetUserSettingsResponse\" } ``` Note that this method is most expensive and so the other get-methods (described in the paragraphs above) are preferred. ### DeleteUserSettings Client detected that `Foo1` is no longer supported and therefore the client removes it to avoid traveling this user setting over and over again between client and server. ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ \"Foo1\" ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflDeleteUserSettingsRequest\" } ``` If the client has received obsoleted settings, it is their responsibility to remove those settings. ### SaveUserSettings Client noticed a value change in the user setting `Bar` and fires a save request. The Bar setting already exists in the database so the value will simply be updated. ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Bar\", \"Value\": \"456\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflSaveUserSettingsRequest\" } ``` Client noticed a value change in the user setting `Foo2` and fires a save request. The `Foo2` setting does exists yet in the database and so it will be added. ```json { ... \"Settings\": [ { \"Setting\": \"Foo2\", \"Value\": \"abc\", \"__classname__\": \"Setting\" } ], ... \"__classname__\": \"WflSaveUserSettingsRequest\" } ``` ### LogOff Client tells that settings are not managed through LogOn\/LogOff. ```json { ... \"SaveSettings\": false, \"Settings\": null, ... \"__classname__\": \"WflLogOffRequest\" } ``` ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: System Administration sortid: 300 permalink: 1041-system-admin --- ## Adding Sub-Applications to Content Station \\[since 9.0\\] This chapter won\u2019t tell you how to develop your sub-application in Flex nor how to physically embed it into Content Station. Instead it describes how to enable admin users to configure access rights for your own sub-applications that run inside Content Station and how to provide a download URL which enables users to install or upgrade your application with ease. First you need to develop a Server Plug-in. Since Enterprise Server 9.0 that is as simple as creating a folder in the Enterprise\/config\/plugins folder with a name (camel case) followed by running the Server Plug-ins page. In the folder you\u2019ll find a new PluginInfo.php file that was generated for you. In that file you should uncomment the following option (by removing the leading \/\/ slashes): `\/\/ 'SysGetSubApplications_EnterpriseConnector',` Save the file and run the Server Plug-ins page again, which now generates a connector that implements the SysGetSubApplications\\_EnterpriseConnector interface. Open the &lt;YourPluginName&gt;\\_SysGetSubApplications.class.php file and implement the runAfter() function as follows: ```php final public function runAfter( SysGetSubApplicationsRequest $req, SysGetSubApplicationsResponse &$resp ) { if( is_null($req->ClientAppName) || \/\/ request for all clients? $req->ClientAppName == 'ContentStation' ) { \/\/ request for this client only? require_once BASEDIR.'\/server\/interfaces\/services\/sys\/DataClasses.php'; $subApp = new SysSubApplication(); $subApp->ID = 'ContentStation_FooSubApp'; $subApp->Version = '1.0.0 Build 1'; $subApp->PackageUrl = 'http:\/\/foosubapp.com'; $subApp->DisplayName = 'Foo Sub App'; $subApp->ClientAppName = 'ContentStation'; $resp->SubApplications[] = $subApp; } } ``` Having the Server Plug-in activated, when the admin user now runs the Profile Maintenance page (under Access Profiles menu), the SysGetSubApplications service is called and so the code snippet above is executed. As a result, your sub-application is listed under the Applications section at the Profile Maintenance page. This enables the admin user to set up a profile that gives end-users access to your sub-application. On the Brand Maintenance page under User Authorizations, the admin user can select that profile for certain user groups. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link web-services-guide\/images\/image48.png %}) With the access profiles in place, when the end-user logs in to Content Station, Enterprise Server returns the profiles that are configured for that user. By default, all applications are assumed to be enabled. For such applications, simply no information is returned in the profile at all. Only when an application has been disabled in a profile will an entry be added to the LogOnResponse for that AppFeature. The value for it is set to \u201cNo\u201d as shown in the following fragment of the LogOnResponse: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <FeatureProfiles> ... <FeatureProfile> <Name>Access Sample<\/Name> <Features> ... <AppFeature> <Name>ContentStation_FooSubApp<\/Name> <Value>No<\/Value> <\/AppFeature> ``` In the very same response, Content Station checks which profiles have been configured for the Publications (= Brands). The following fragment shows how access profiles are organized per Brand: ```xml <LogOnResponse> ... <Publications> <PublicationInfo> ... <FeatureAccessList> <FeatureAccess> <Profile>Access Sample<\/Profile> <Issue xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <Section xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <State xsi:nil=\"true\"\/> <\/FeatureAccess> <\/FeatureAccessList> ... ``` Looking at both fragments above, if any PublicationInfo (=Brand) has a FeatureAccess (=profile reference) that corresponds with a FeatureProfile (=profile definition) for which the sub-application is not listed, Content Station will show your sub-application since the user has access to it (through at least one of the Brands). Obviously that is only the case when your sub-application is returned through the SysGetSubApplications service. ",

        "content": "--- layout: chapter title: Workflow Dialogs sortid: 010 permalink: 1054-workflow-dialogs --- Through Dialog Setup pages, system administrators can configure workflow dialogs per Brand, object type and action. When a client is about to show a workflow dialog, such definitions are requested through the GetDialog workflow service (as specified in the SCEnterprise.wsdl). Whenever the user selects another Brand, Issue, Category or status, the client requests for that dialog definition (requesting for GetDialog again) and redraws the entire dialog. For Brand and overrule Issue selections, the redraw is needed because the entire workflow definition and dialog configuration could be different. For (normal) Issue selections the list of requested Dossiers could differ. For status- and Category changes, the Route To selection could differ. And, in all cases, the editable\/read-only status could differ due to access rights. System integrators can overrule the standard server behavior of the GetDialog service through server plug-ins. This is why clients should have no logics nor assume or predict certain behavior. Instead, they should listen to the GetDialog response and fully rely on that. The LogOn response should no longer be used by any 7.x compliant client to get definitions in relation to workflow dialogs. Also, there is no reason anymore to call the GetStates service since that is embraced by the GetDialog service. ## History - Since 5.0, the GetDialog service was introduced and used by the Web Editor only. - Since 6.0, Publication Channel awareness has been added to the GetDialog service. Content Station started using it (but is still using the LogOn response too to build dialogs). - Since 7.0, new features have been added to the service and InDesign \/ InCopy clients started using the service. The service itself is also improved and logics are moved from the clients to the service: - The returned PublicationInfo element tree has been pruned, clarifying what response information should be used by the clients. - The enabled status of properties is determined by the service (instead of the clients). - The Route To pre-selection is determined by the service (instead of the clients). ## GetDialog service **Element structure** | **Description** -----------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ticket | \\[Mandatory\\] The ticket as retrieved through the LogOn response. ID | Object ID. Nil for Create action. Mandatory for any other action. Publication | Publication ID. Nil when ID, Layout or Template is provided, but is mandatory to redraw dialog. Issue | Issue ID. Nil for initial draw. Mandatory to redraw the dialog. Section | Section ID. Nil for initial draw. Mandatory to redraw the dialog. State | \\[7.0\\] Status ID. Nil for initial draw. Mandatory to redraw the dialog. Type | Object type. Action | Workflow operation. See Action definition for possible values. The empty value is not allowed in this context. For Save-As operations, the Create action should be used. RequestDialog | Request for Dialog element at response time. RequestPublication | Request for Publications and PublicationInfo elements at response time. RequestMetaData | Request for MetaData element at response time. (Has no impact on Dialog-&gt;MetaData.) RequestStates | Request for GetStatesResponse element at response time. RequestTargets | \\[6.0\\] Request for the Targets property (PropertyUsage element) at response time. Clients should pass \u201ctrue\u201d when they support the complex target widget that holds the Issues and Editions. The server determines where the Targets property should be placed in the dialog. Clients should then ignore the Issues and Editions property positions. DefaultDossier | \\[7.0\\] Dossier object ID. Request to populate the Dossiers element at response time as well as to return the Dossier property at the Dialog definition. The given Publication, Issue and Section are used to get Dossiers. The DefaultDossier is also used to set the default value as the Dossier property. If DefaultDossier is nil (or left out) no Dossier property nor Dossiers will be returned. See also \\[1\\]. Parent | \\[7.0\\] Parent object ID. In the specific case when creating objects that are already placed (such as creating articles from a layout) the client knows that the object will be placed, but the server does not know yet. (Existing placement relations are resolved server-side.) When the Parent has targets, the RelatedTargets will hold targets of this additional parent too. And, instead of the current Issue, the parent\u2019s Issue is preselected (returned through GetDialogResponse -&gt; Targets). This is because placed objects are assumed to travel along with their parents. Also, the Brand \/ Category are taken from the Parent when Publication \/ Section are not given. When the Parent is a Layout Module (or Layout Module Template) the Brand, Issue and Editions are inherited. The Publication and Issue parameters are then ignored. Template | \\[7.0\\] Template object ID. Should only be given when Action = \u201cCreate\u201d; else nil. When creating objects, most MetaData should be taken from a template. Those should be pre-filled for the new object in the Create workflow dialog. Provide the object ID of the template (that was picked by user) to let the server inherit its MetaData structure. Nil (or left out) means that the object is not created from the template. For Save As operations, the Template parameter can be used to pass the original object ID from which the MetaData will be inherited. Unlike the Parent parameter, the template\u2019s Issue is not used for preselection. This is because in most cases there is a special templates issue, or templates do not have an Issue assigned. \\[1\\] 'Dossier' is a property introduced in 7.0 and can be configured in the Dialog Setup Maintenance page. When a dialog is not customized, a default dialog is assumed by the server, which now also includes the Dossier property. Unlike other properties, the Dossier property is only shown in the dialogs when useful. That is, when the client and server can both handle it. If one doesn\u2019t, the Dossier property won\u2019t be shown in the dialog. For client side, that means it is able to: * Parse the Dossiers element in the GetDialog response. * Draw a pull-down widget populated with those Dossiers. * Pass the chosen Dossier ID (by the end user) through the object relations of the next request. For the Create dialog, that is the CreateObjects request. For server-side, that means it is able to: * Support the Object-in-Dossier relation. For example, for 7.0, Dossier-in-Dossier is not supported, and so Dossier and DossierTemplate objects won\u2019t get a Dossier property. * Support implicit Dossier creation for \u2018next\u2019 called service. Since 7.0. this is implemented for the CreateObjects service, and so, only for Create dialogs, the Dossier property is shown. When a client does meet all its criteria listed above, it passes 0 (zero) or a valid Dossier ID for the DefaultDossier parameter; else nil. When the server received a 0 (zero) or valid Dossier ID, and all its criteria listed above are met, (and the Dossier is configured in the Dialog Setup, or default dialog is picked), it returns the Dossier property (through the GetDialogResponse-&gt;Dialog elements). Clients do not worry about server criteria, so they pass 0 (zero) or a valid Dossier ID for any object type, including Dossier objects. Let\u2019s assume that Enterprise Server 8.0 supports Dossier-in-Dossier relations. When a 7.x compliant client is talking to a 8.0 server, the Dossier property will then be shown in the dialog, and will work well. Let\u2019s assume that for Enterprise Server 8.0 the CopyTo dialog supports the Dossier property. Any 8.0 compliant client passes a value for DefaultDossier parameter and the server returns the Dossier property, which is shown in the dialog. The client then passes the chosen Dossier ID (by end user) through the CopyObjects service. But, when a 7.x compliant client is talking to a 8.0 server, the DefaultDossier parameter is set to nil, and *no* Dossier property is shown. And vice versa, when a 8.0 compliant client is talking to a 7.x server, the client passes a value for DefaultDossier parameter, but the server does not return the Dossier property, and so it is not shown in the dialog. When the user is about to Create a new object, the server resolves and returns the Dossiers to let the user pick one. Even when there are no Dossiers found, the Dossier property is returned. Note that the \"New Dossier\" item (ID=-1) always exists in the list of Dossiers. This allows users to create a new Dossier, even when there are none found. There is also an empty item (ID=0) which means there is no need to create a Dossier. When a user submits the dialog, the client should pass the Dossier in the object relations (type Contained) of the CreateObjects request. (This should be done for ID &lt;&gt; 0 only.) The Publication, Issue, Section and State parameters indicate the user\u2019s selection in the workflow dialog. By passing those parameters, clients ask the server how the dialog should be drawn for the given publication\/Issue, regardless of the actual publication\/issue of the object as stored in the database. So, these parameters are \u2018strongest\u2019 and overrule any other sever logics deriving publication\/Issue from parent objects, template objects, configured current Issue, etc, etc. Important is that clients pass -no- Publication parameter the \u2018first time\u2019. That way, server logics can kick in, but more over, custom server plug-ins can even overrule those logics by choosing specific publication\/Issue. The ones that are initially picked by the server can be read from the GetDialogResponse -&gt; Dialog -&gt; MetaData. The Publication, Section and State parameters imply what access profile is respected. For example, the \u201cChange Pub\/Issue\/Category\u201d option is resolved and so the properties mentioned are made read-only or editable (by GetDialog service). The table below shows what combination of parameters are expected. Other combinations are not supported. As you can see, when asked for a Create action, no object ID should be passed, but a Type is required. For other actions, it is the other way around. And, only for redraw operations, Publication, Issue and Section should be passed. Except for creating new objects without Parent\/Template; the client should pass a Publication, which should be taken from the context the user is working in. For example: the last used publication, or the publication currently selected in the Search pane. **Event** | ID | Type | PT(2) | Pub | Issue | Section | Status -------------------------------| --------| ----------| -------------| ---------| --------------- | -------------| ------------ Action: Create^(1)^ - initial | \u2718 | \u2714 | \u2718 | \u2714 | \u2714\/\u2718 **^(4)^** | \u2718 | \u2718 Action: Create^(1)^ - initial | \u2718 | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2718 | \u2718 | \u2718 | \u2718 Action: Other - initial | \u2714 | \u2718 | \u2714 | \u2718 | \u2718 | \u2718 | \u2718 Change: pub\/overrule^(3)^ | - | - | - | \u2714 | \u2714\/\u2718 **^(4)^** | \u2718 | \u2718 Change: issue\/sec\/stat^(5)^ | - | - | - | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 | \u2714 Legend: \u2714 = valid ID (not empty, not zero) \u2718 = nil \\- = depends on the action (inherited from one of the first three lines above) 1) For Save As operations, the Action parameter should be set to Create. Note: Although the dialog caption says Check-In, technically we speak of a Create action. 2) Whether or not a Parent (ID) or Template (ID) was provided. This is used to derive the publication (and overrule Issue) from. 3) When user selects other Brand or overrule Issue, a GetDialog request is fired and the dialog is redrawn. The entire dialog definition can change, so a full redraw is required. 4) For overrule Issue: \u2714, but for normal Issue: \u2718. 5) When a user selects (normal) Issue, section or status, GetDialog request is fired to let the server reflect access rights profile settings to the dialog fields, and to refill certain lists, such as Dossiers, sections and statuses. ## GetDialogResponse **Element structure** | **Description** -----------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Dialog | Workflow dialog definition. \u21b3 Tabs | Defines tabs and widgets to draw. The tab sequence represents the z-order with first the tab on top. For each tab, widgets are listed. The sequence needs to be respected with the first widget on top. For each widget, the usage is defined; whether or not to show read-only, mandatory, etc. When client supports the complex Targets widget, it should combine the Issues and Editions widgets and draw the Targets widget instead. The Targets position should be respected. If the client does not support the Targets widget, it should ignore it and simply draw Issues and Editions widgets. \u21b3 MetaData | For each widget under the Tabs element, a value is given to pre-fill \/ pre-select in the dialog. Publications | The Brands (ids and names) for which user has access. Used to populate the Brand pull-down menu. PublicationInfo | The configuration definition of the current Brand. For new objects, this is the requested Brand (through GetDialog -&gt; Publication). For existing objects, this is the object\u2019s Brand. \u21b3 PubChannels | The Brand\u2019s publication channels, Issues and Editions definitions. Used to populate the Issues and Editions pull-down menus. When requested for an overrule Issue (through GetDialog -&gt; Issue), the corresponding IssueInfo holds its Categories and Editions definitions, which is used to populate the pull-down menu instead. \u21b3 Categories | The Categories (ids and names) configured on Brand level. Used to populate the Category pull-down menu. MetaData | The current object properties as stored in the database (regardless of the requested Brand\/Issue). Used to create or update an object once the dialog is submitted. This way, calling the GetObjects service first is not needed. When requested for a template (GetDialog -&gt; Template) much of the template\u2019s metadata is inherited. Typically used to create a new article from the article template. GetStatesResponse | Statuses, users and user groups to which the object can be sent. Used to populate the Status and Route To pull-down menus. Targets | For existing objects, these are the object targets as stored in the database. Except when a user is switching to\/from another Brand or Overrule Issue. In that case, the object targets are replaced with one target to the current Issue of the default channel. For new objects, these are the initial targets derived from the given parent (layout), Dossier, or template. If there are no such derivable objects given, the current Issue of the default channel is the server\u2019s best guess. These targets should be shown (by the clients) when -initially- showing the dialog. And also, when a user has selected another Brand or overrule Issue, clients should clear the currently user built target list shown in the dialog and respect the targets return from the server. But, when a user selects a normal Issue, Category or status, a redraw is required too, in which case the current user targets are preserved (and the returned targets from the server are ignored) by clients. RelatedTargets | The parent\u2019s targets, in case the object is placed and\/or Dossier\u2019s relational\\* targets in case the object is contained by a Dossier. For example, the layout\u2019s targets in case an article is placed on that layout. There can be zero, one, or many parents\/Dossiers involved. A maximum of 5 parents are returned and a maximum of 5 Dossiers. When these limits are exceeded, a dummy item is returned named \u201c...\u201d. \\* These are -not- the Dossier\u2019s targets, but the targets set for the contained object within the Dossier (called relational targets). Dossiers | List of Dossiers (ids and names) available within the requested Brand\/Issue. Only provided when requested for (GetDialog -&gt; DefaultDossier). Used to populate the Dossiers pull-down menu. ### Exceptional standard dialog behavior #### Disabling the Editions property For Task, Hyperlink, Library, Plan and Other objects, Editions are always disabled. #### Disabling Brand \/ Issue \/ Editions property for Layout Module placements For objects placed on Layout Modules (or Layout Module Templates), the Brand, Issue and Editions properties are disabled. This is because Editions are inherited from the module and are not allowed to change (in order for its placements to preserve data integrity). #### Disabling Brand \/ Issue \/ Editions \/ Category property for placements The Create dialogs for Articles and Image objects show disabled Brand, Issue, Editions and Category properties when they are created from a Layout. #### Disabling Status property and the Personal Status For existing objects, the Change Status access option is respected, and so you will risk having a disabled Status property. This is correct, except when the Personal status is currently selected. (Reason: no-one else can see the object other than the user to whom the object is routed to, but that user cannot change the status, and so an admin user would need to be asked to solve this problem, which is unwanted.) So, when an object is in the Personal Status, the Status property is enabled. #### Disabling properties in the Set Properties dialog When an object is already locked for editing, the Set Properties dialog shows all disabled properties. This is done by the client, not by the server (because InDesign\/InCopy clients do pessimistic locking and so in both cases the object is locked and the server cannot tell the difference). This implies that the Server Plug-ins cannot alter the enabled status of the properties in this specific situation. #### Automatic user input focus For workflow dialogs, the focus (caret) is set to the Status property. For the Create and Copy To dialogs, or when the Status property is disabled, the focus is set to the Name field. #### Limited Edition items When an object is placed on a Layout (or LayoutModule or Layout Template), the Create and Check-In workflow dialogs list limited Editions items: only those Editions that are currently assigned to the Layout. #### Inactive, but assigned Issues Inactive Issues are not listed in the workflow dialogs, except for those Issues (and their Editions) that are currently assigned to the object. The user can deselect such inactive Issues (because they are assigned). However, the next time the workflow dialog raises, unassigned Issues that are inactive are no longer listed. #### \u2018Change\u2019 access rights not applied to Create and Copy To dialogs The Access Profiles Maintenance page contains the following 'Change' access rights options: * Change Brand\/Issue\/Category * Change Edition * Change Status By toggling the Brand\/Category\/Status properties in the Create dialog, because of the access rights mentioned, those properties could 'suddenly' get disabled. There would be no escape from that point. To avoid such deadlocks, the Brand\/Issue\/Category\/Edition\/Status properties are enabled for the Create dialog (except in case there are other rules telling to disable the properties, such as Create Article on a Layout Module for which they should be disabled). In short, the Create dialog ignores the 'Change' access options. #### Property inheritance for Create and Copy To dialogs When objects are about to be copied, or created from a template or directly created onto a parent layout, properties are inherited (from the source\/template\/parent object) and pre-filled in the dialog. This is done for all properties, except for the following: * ID * Document ID * Name, Type * Content Source * Deadline * Urgency * Creator * Created * Modifier * Modified * Comment * Status * Route To * Locked By * Version * Deadline Soft * Rating Those properties are cleared, and so empty properties are shown in the dialog. Nevertheless, some of those properties are automatically re-determined, such as: Name, Type, Status, Route To and Version. Those are pre-filled (with possibly a different value than the source object). ## GetDialog2 service \\[since 8.0\\] Smart Connection 7.x for InDesign \/ InCopy and Content Station 7.x call the *GetDialog service* each time when user changes a property value (dialog field) for which the \u2018Refresh\u2019 flag is enabled. The request contains the new user typed value. That way, a custom server plug-in is able to act on the change. Since Enterprise Server 8.0, there is a new service, called GetDialog2, which supersedes the GetDialog service. Its request and the response are simplified to make it easier for clients, especially when it comes to refreshing dialogs. Basically it does the same, but instead of separate parameters, structured data trees are round-tripped through MetaData and Targets. This takes away the need to cache user typed data, which is quite complicated to merge on the way back. This makes clients rely even more on the server behavior, which results into more consistent behavior between clients. At least for the 8.x versions, the GetDialog is still supported to allow clients to migrate to GetDialog2. Clients are encouraged to do so. This is where clients pick-up data from server to show at dialog: ``` GetDialog2Response Dialog ... MetaData MetaDataValue ... Targets Target ``` When redrawing the dialog, the user typed data is round-tripped through the new parameters as follows: ``` GetDialog2 ... MetaData MetaDataValue Targets Target ``` For client convenience, the MetaData tree is not used (with BasicMetaData, etc), but instead, the list structure is used (with MetaDataValue). Custom properties are supported and are prefixed with \u201cC\\_\u201d. In 7.x, the following properties are round-tripped through a fixed set of GetDialog service parameters: ``` GetDialog ... ID Publication Issue Category Status Type ... ``` There is one exceptional field; The RouteTo field should respect the Brand\u2019s Routing configuration which is taken care of by the core server. The round-trips caused by the Refresh fields should not disturb this existing feature. To optimize data traffic and server-side execution speed, clients can request for less data, in case they don\u2019t need that much. In 7.x, this is done as follows: ```xml <GetDialog> ... <RequestDialog>true<\/RequestDialog> <RequestPublication>true<\/RequestPublication> <RequestMetaData>true<\/RequestMetaData> <RequestStates>true<\/RequestStates> <RequestTargets>true<\/RequestTargets> ... ``` and as a result, the following data structure is filled in (or not): ``` GetDialogResponse Dialog Publications PublicationInfo MetaData GetStatesResponse Targets RelatedTargets Dossiers ``` Since 8.0, the response structure has changed into this: ``` GetDialog2Response MetaData Targets RelatedTargets ``` As you can see, there are much less data elements returned, since that data is now moved to the MetaDataValue structure with id-name pairs. And so, there is no longer need to have filtering parameters, which are therefore not present at the GetDialog2 request. ### Show display names for internal values \\[since 8.0\\] For configured data structures, such as Brands, Issues, etc, the client and server communicate DB ids, while showing display names to end users. To do such, both sides need to know about the configured data structures, which is very dedicated and therefore limited to built-in (known) properties. In 7.x, there is no common structure that can hold both internal values and display names. With Enterprise Server 8.0 there is, and so custom properties can use those, but also the built-in properties can be expressed in a more common way. This takes out some client logic, which makes things less dependent and specific. The structure that holds the values, is defined as follows, whereby 8.0 changes are in bold: ```xml <complexType name=\"MetaDataValue\"> <all> <element name=\"Property\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Values\" type=\"tns:ArrayOfString\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"\/> <element name=\"PropertyValues\" type=\"tns:ArrayOfPropertyValue\u201d minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"\/> <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` The following definitions are added since Enterprise Server 8.0 as well: ```xml <complexType name=\"PropertyValue\"> <all> <element name=\"Value\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Display\" type=\"xsd:string\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"\/> <!-- optional --> <\/all> <\/complexType> <complexType name=\"ArrayOfPropertyValue\"> <complexContent> <restriction base=\"soap-enc:Array\"> <attribute ref=\"soap-enc:arrayType\" wsdl:arrayType=\"tns:PropertyValue[]\"\/> <\/restriction> <\/complexContent> <\/complexType> ``` 7.x example of usage, which is dis-encouraged: ```xml <MetaDataValue> <Property>Publication<\/Property> <Values> <String>1<\/String> <\/Values> <\/MetaDataValue> ``` 8.0 example of usage: ```xml <MetaDataValue> <Property>Publication<\/Property> <PropertyValues> <PropertyValue> <Value>1<\/Value> <Display>WW News<\/Display> <\/PropertyValue> <\/PropertyValues> <\/MetaDataValue> ``` Sending values and display names (like above) are applied to Publications, PubChannels, Issues, Categories, Editions, Users and UserGroups. ### Refresh dialog fields \\[since 8.0\\] Workflow dialogs guide users through their workflow. Even though dialogs are already made very flexible, Enterprise Server 8.0 takes another step; It enables application engineers to redraw the dialog in specific cases for which some fields needs to be \u2018refreshed\u2019. For example, a customer might wish that, when an end-user tags a checkbox \u2018Department\u2019 on a workflow dialog, the listed items at the Route To field gets filtered automatically, showing only the users and groups working for the same department as the current user. Or the other way around, when the Route To field is changed by the end user, the customer might want to have a readonly \u2018Department\u2019 text field to be filled in automatically, with the value configured for the selected user. There could also be a need to let one field depend on two others, and those fields do not necessarily have to be custom. For example, when the Issue field is set to a print channel and the Edition is set to \u2018north\u2019 only, the customer might wish to enter a simplified workflow and so less statuses needs to be shown at the Status field. The triggers can be both ways, or relate one-to-many and\/or custom fields or built-in fields can be involved. The rules and dependencies can be developed through a custom server plug-in. Admin users can not interfere with such complicated rules other than enabling or disabling the whole feature through the Server Plug-ins admin page. A new flag added to the workflow WSDL, named \u2018Refresh\u2019: ```xml <complexType name=\"PropertyUsage\"> <all> <element name=\"Name\" type=\"xsd:string\"\/> <element name=\"Editable\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"\/> <element name=\"Mandatory\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"\/> <element name=\"Restricted\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"\/> <element name=\"Refresh\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"\/> <\/all> <\/complexType> ``` This indicates that when the field is changed by the end-user, the GetDialog service needs to be called by client applications to redraw the dialog. The core server sets this flag for the Brand, overrule Issue and Status fields, which represents the current behavior. ### Multiple objects support \\[since 9.2\\] Since Enterprise Server 9.2, a new parameter 'MultipleObjects' is added to the request. This boolean field can be used to specify whether the dialog is being drawn for a single object (false or nil) or for multiple objects (true). For backwards compatibility with older clients, the parameter is optional. A request without this parameter is interpreted as a Set Properties operation for a single object. Based on the parameter value, advanced business rules may apply when determining the dialog options, only returning those properties that apply when handling multiple objects. ### Dropped support for the Overrule Brand option \\[since 10.7.0\\] Since Enterprise Server 10.7.0 the option to determine if an Issue should have its own Categories, Workflow, and User Authorization definitions is removed. References to this option in both the Admin as the Workflow services will result in an error (Missing function parameter (S1000)). ",
