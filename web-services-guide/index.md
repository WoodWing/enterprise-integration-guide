## Introduction
This guide intends not to be complete but to give a good starting point for integrating systems with Enterprise. 
The explained concepts provide basic ideas and behavior which are concealed underneath Enterpriseâ€™s abstract entities. 
This theory is frequently diversified by concrete examples to visualize how things actually work.
This guide can be used for Enterprise 6 or higher.
