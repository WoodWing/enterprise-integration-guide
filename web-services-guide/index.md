## Introduction
This guide intends not to be complete but to give a good starting point for integrating systems with WoodWing Studio. 
The explained concepts provide basic ideas and behavior which are concealed underneath Studioâ€™s abstract entities. 
This theory is frequently diversified by concrete examples to visualize how things actually work.

## Re-branded
Studio Server 10.10 is based on Enterprise Server 10.9 and is technically the same. 
Apart from re-branding it by changing logos and product name references at various places, no additional changes have been made.

## Required knowledge
We assume the reader of this guide is familiar with:
* The functionality of the Studio system. 
* The configuration of the Studio system.
* Web Services, SOAP and WSDL. For more information, see http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/.
* PHP language. For more information, see: www.php.net.
