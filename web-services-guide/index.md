## Introduction
This guide intends not to be complete but to give a good starting point for integrating systems with Enterprise. The explained concepts provide basic ideas and behavior which are concealed underneath Enterprise’s abstract entities. This theory is frequently diversified by concrete examples to visualize how things actually work.
This guide can be used for Enterprise 6 or higher. 

## Required knowledge

* The functionality of the Enterprise system. 
* The configuration of the Enterprise system.
